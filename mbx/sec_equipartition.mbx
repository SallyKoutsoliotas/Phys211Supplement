<title>The Equipartition Theorem</title>
<p>
We now discuss a remarkable relationship between temperature and
thermal energy, referred to as the <em>equipartition theorem</em>. The
basic idea is that in thermodynamic systems, thermal energy is equally
(<q>equi</q>) divided (<q>partition</q>) between certain types of molecular
energy, both kinetic and potential. At first glance, you might think
that this would mean that half of the energy is kinetic and half is
potential (and sometimes this is true), but it is not quite that simple.
For one, only those energy terms which are quadratic in a
dynamical variable (such as <m>\frac{1}{2}mv_x^2</m>) get the equal shares.
For any terms more complicated than that, like the pair potential, we
cannot so easily say how the energy is divided. Also, the number of these
egalitarian quadratic energy terms, often called <em>degrees of freedom</em>,
depends on details such as whether there is rotational as well as
translational kinetic energy.<fn>For a solid the molecules
  essentially do not rotate, but rotational kinetic energy can have a
  significant effect on the thermal energy of a liquid or gas.</fn>

Maybe it will help to see the theorem:

<p>
Any term in the energy of a
molecule that is quadratic, such as <m>\frac{1}{2}mv_x^2</m> or
<m>\frac{1}{2}k_\text{ sp } x^2</m> or <m>\frac{1}{2}I\omega^2</m>, averages to
<m>\frac{1}{2}k_BT</m>.}
</p>

<p>
This amazing result says that when some <m>10^{23}</m> particles push and pull
and collide with each other, all the messy forces involved will result in
every quadratic energy term averaging to the same value. It doesn't
matter if the molecule is heavier or lighter, or what the spring
constant is. It also doesn't matter whether we are talking about
potential energy or translational kinetic energy or rotational kinetic
energy. As long as the energy is quadratic in the dynamical variable,
the thermal energy will depend only on <m>T</m> and
Boltzmann's constant,
<men>
  k_B= 1.38\times 10^{-23}\units{J/K},
</men>
which is another constant of nature. Notice how the units work out:
<m>k_BT</m> is an energy.

In the next sections, we'll use the equipartition theorem to analyze
thermal energy of an ideal solid.

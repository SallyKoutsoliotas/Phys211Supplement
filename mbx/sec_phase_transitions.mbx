<title>Phase Transitions</title>
<p>
Heat up an ice cube and it melts. Heat up a chunk of copper and it
melts also, albeit at a much higher temperature. What is melting, and
what determines the temperature at which a substance melts? Our
ball-spring model, taken literally, cannot exhibit melting, because no
matter how energetically the molecules vibrate, they are still
connected to the same neighbors. But we should recall that the spring
was only an approximation to the molecular pair potential, valid when
the thermal energy was low enough that the molecules were mostly near
the minimum of their potential well. Once a pair of molecules is
stretched far enough apart, their interaction differs from a spring in
that the attractive force between them weakens and ultimately becomes
negligible (see Fig. <xref ref="fig_pair_potential"></xref>). So we need a mental
picture of a <q>spring</q> that weakens and <q>gives up</q> under too much
stretching.
</p>

<p>
We can use the ball-spring model to make a rough estimate of when
melting should occur. The equipartition theorem tells us how far the
molecules move in their vibrations. Let <m>x</m> be the displacement
of a molecule from its equilibrium position in the <m>x</m>-direction. The
average value of <m>x</m> is zero, because the molecule is displaced equal
amounts of time in the <m>+x</m> and <m>-x</m> directions. But the
average value of <m>x^2</m> is not zero and is given by (using the
equipartition theorem)
<men>
  \bigl\langle{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}k_{sp}{x^2}\bigr\rangle =
{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}k_{sp}\langle{x^2}\rangle 
= {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}k_BT.
\Rightarrow
\langle x^2\rangle = \frac{k_BT}{k_{sp}}.
</men>
</p>

<p>
This tells us the typical size of the excursions. We can define a
thermal displacement magnitude
<men xml:id="eq_x_thermal" >
  x_\text{ therm }  = \sqrt{\langle x^2\rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{k_BT}{k_{sp}}},
</men>
which exhibits the reasonable behavior that the higher the temperature,
the farther the molecule moves (on average) from equilibrium.
</p>

<example>
<statement>
<p>
{Wiggling copper atoms.}
Copper is a solid at room temperature, <m>T=295\units{K}</m>. As the
copper atom oscillates about its equilibrium position, what is the
typical magnitude of its displacement in the <m>x</m>-direction?


<em>Solution: </em> From Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_x_thermal" />, we get
<men>
  x_\text{ therm }  = \sqrt{\frac{(1.38\times 10^{-23}\units{J/K})(295\units{K})}
{29.6\units{N/m}}} =  1.17\times 10^{-11}\units{m}.
</men>
where we used the copper spring constant from
<xref ref="chapter_thermal_energy">chapter</xref>. Note that we used SI
units, so <m>x_\text{ therm }</m> comes out in meters.
</p>

<p>
Is this answer reasonable? Recall that the equilibrium distance
between copper atoms is <m>d=2.28\times 10^{-10}\units{m}</m>, which is
about 20 times larger. So at room temperature, copper molecules are
vibrating somewhere around 5<percent /> of the distance of their separation.
That sounds plausible.
</p>
</statement>
</example>

<p>
Melting occurs when the molecular excursions become an appreciable
fraction of the bond length <m>d</m>, an idea is known as the <em> Lindemann criterion</em>. Lindemann found empirically<fn>i.e.,
simply by looking at the experimental data</fn> that a reasonable estimate
for the melting temperature can be obtained by setting <m>x_\text{ therm } 
\approx d/10</m>. Note that if <m>x_\text{ therm }  \approx d/10</m>, it does
not mean that each atom in the solid is vibrating precisely <m>d/10</m>
from the equilibrium; some are going further, and some are going less.
The Lindemann criterion implies
<men>
  x_\text{ therm }  = \sqrt{\frac{k_BT_m}{k_{sp}}} \approx d/10 \Rightarrow
T_m \approx \frac{d^2k_{sp}}{100 k_B}
</men>
</p>

<p>
This is not an highly accurate estimate, but it does capture some
general features. For example, lead has a relatively low melting
temperature, which is evidently due to its weak spring constant.
An estimate for copper, based on the ball-spring parameters, is
<men>
  T_{m} \approx \frac{(2.28\times 10^{-10}\units{m})^2(29.6\units{N/m})}
{100(1.38\times 10^{-23}\units{J/K})} = 1120\units{K}
</men>
which is comparable to the measured value of <m>1358\units{K}</m>. Iron
has a stronger spring constant that copper, and correspondingly a
higher melting temperature.

In the solid state, whenever thermal energy is added to an object, the
temperature increases. However, when the temperature of a solid
reaches the melting temperature, additional thermal energy no longer
causes temperature increase but rather phase change. Adding a little
thermal energy to a solid at the melting temperature causes a few of
the molecules to break from the lattice structure and become liquid.
Adding more thermal energy causes even more molecules to become
liquid. While this is happening, the temperature of the material is
not changing. Rather, a solid with temperature <m>T_m</m> is being
converted to a liquid at temperature <m>T_m</m>, as shown in
Fig. <xref ref="fig_etherm_vs_t"></xref>. The amount of thermal energy required to
convert one mole of a solid to a liquid is called the <em>latent heat
of fusion</em>, and denoted by the symbol <m>L_f</m>. Given the latent heat
of fusion for a material, it is straightforward to determine how much
energy is needed to melt a certain amount of that material:
<men xml:id="eq_latent_heat" >
  |\Delta E_\text{ therm } | = nL_f,\qquad\text{ (melt/solidify) }
</men>
where <m>n</m> is the number of moles of the material. This same relation
can be used to determine how much energy is released when a certain
amount of a liquid is frozen into solid form. Energy must be added to
melt something, and energy is released when something freezes. Latent
heats for a few materials are given in
<xref ref="table_phase_transitions">Table</xref>.
</p>
<figure xml:id="fig_etherm_vs_t" >
<caption>Shown is <m>E_ therm</m> versus <m>T</m> for one mole of a
  typical material.  The slopes in the solid phase and liquid phase
  are the molar specific heats, which are not typically equal to each
  other.  The vertical jump at <m>T_m</m> represents the latent heat of
  fusion, i.e., the amount of thermal energy required to change
  phase.</caption>

<example>
<statement>
<p>
{Melting lead}
Calculate the amount of thermal energy that has to be added to 3.0
moles of lead at room temperature to melt <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> of the lead.
</p>

<p>
<em>Solution: </em>
This is a two-part process. First the temperature of the solid lead
solid must be raised to its melting temperature. <em>Then</em> the
lead can be melted.
</p>

<p>
In the first part of the process the temperature of all of the lead
increases to <m>600\units{K}</m>. The thermal energy change corresponding
to this is given by
<md>
  <mrow>  \Delta E_\text{ therm } ^{(1)} \amp  = n_1C\Delta T \nonumber</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp  = 3.0\units{mol}\times 26.6\units{J/mol$\cdot$K} \times
        (600\units{K} - 295\units{K}) \nonumber</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp  = 24.3 \units{kJ}</mrow>
</md>
</p>

<p>
In the second part of the process the phase changes, so the
thermal energy change necessary to melt two moles of the lead is given by
<md>
  <mrow>  \Delta E_\text{ therm } ^{(2)} \amp  = n_2 L_f \nonumber</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp  = 2.0\units{mol} \times 4.77\times 10^3\units{J/mol} \nonumber</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp  = 9.5\units{kJ}</mrow>
</md>
</p>

<p>
Combining these two thermal energy changes gives
<md>
  <mrow>  \left(\Delta E_\text{ therm } \right)_\text{ total }  
    \amp  = \Delta E_\text{ therm } ^{(1)} + \Delta E_\text{ therm } ^{(2)} \nonumber</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp  = 24.3\units{kJ} + 9.5\units{kJ} \nonumber</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp  = 33.8\units{kJ} \</mrow>
</md>
</p>

<p>
In this calculation, we used the measured value for the molar
specific heat for lead (see <xref ref="table_material_properties">Table</xref>).
We could have used the Dulong-Petit (ball-spring) approximation (<m>C
  = 3R</m>) which would have given us a result very close to the value
that we calculated here.
</p>

<p>
Note also that if we wanted to start with 2 moles of liquid lead
and 1 mole of solid lead both at <m>600\units{K}</m>, and cool it down to
a solid at room temperature, the same calculation would
tell us how much thermal energy we would need to <em>remove</em>. It
would also be <m>33.8\units{kJ}</m>.
</p>

For most substances, there exists a boiling point separating a liquid
phase from a gas phase. At the molecular level, the liquid state has
nearly solid-like density, with molecules packed close together and
fairly near the minimum of the potential well. The transition to the
gas phase requires pulling these molecules apart and setting them
free, where they have no neighbors. Let <m>E_\text{ bind }</m> be the depth
of the potential well, that is, <m>E_\text{ bind }</m> is the amount of
energy needed to bring a pair of molecules from their equilibrium
separation to far apart from each other (see
Fig. <xref ref="fig_boiling"></xref>(a)). Vaporization (or boiling) occurs roughly
when <m>k_BT\approx E_\text{ bind }</m>, so we can estimate the boiling
temperature as
<men xml:id="eq_t_v" >
  T_v\approx\frac{E_\text{ bind } }{k_B}.
</men>
</p>

<example>
<statement>
<p>
{Molecular Binding Energy}
Estimate the molecular pair binding energy <m>E_\text{ bind }</m> for
copper, using the information in
<xref ref="table_phase_transitions">Table</xref>. 

<em>Solution: </em> Copper vaporizes at
<m>T_v = 2835\units{K}</m>, so we may estimate
<men>
  E_\text{ bind } ^{ Cu} \approx k_B T_v = (1.38\times 10^{-23}\units{J/K})
    (2835\units{K}) = 3.91\times 10^{-20}\units{J}.
</men>
</p>

<p>
A convenient energy unit for describing molecular bonds is the
electron volt (eV), defined as
<men>
  1\units{eV} = 1.60\times 10^{-19}\units{J}.
</men>
</p>

<p>
In terms of electron volts, then,
<men>
  E_\text{ bind } ^{ Cu} = 
    \frac{3.91\times 10^{-20}\units{J}}{1.60\times 10^{-19}\units{J/eV}} 
    = 0.245\units{eV}
</men>
</p>
</statement>
</example>

<figure xml:id="fig_boiling" >
<caption>(a) The pair potential depth <m>E_ bind</m>.  (b) Removing a particle
from the liquid state requires an energy of about 10<ndash />12<m>E_ bind</m>.</caption>
<image width="82%" source="images/boiling.png" />
</figure>
<p>
Like with melting, vaporization requires an input of thermal energy.
As thermal energy is added, the temperature remains fixed at the
vaporization temperature, while an increasing amount of liquid gets
converted to gas. The amount of energy required to convert a mole of
a substance from liquid to gas is called the <em>latent heat of
vaporization</em>. This is used much the same way as the latent heat of
fusion:
<men>
  |\Delta E_\text{ therm } | = nL_v. \qquad\text{ (vaporize/condense) }
</men>
</p>

<p>
As before, <m>\Delta E_\text{ therm }</m> is positive if we are adding
thermal energy to vaporize, and it is negative if we are removing
thermal energy to condense.
</p>

<p>
One final comment about latent heat and phase transitions: the amount
of heat needed to melt or boil most common materials is quite large.
Just looking at <xref ref="table_material_properties">Tables</xref> and <xref ref="table_phase_transitions"></xref>, you can see that it is necessary to add a
<q>k</q> to the units for latent heats <m>L_f</m> and <m>L_v</m> (versus the units
for molar specific heat <m>C</m>) because we are usually talking about
thousands of Joules of energy to cause a phase transition for each
mole of the substance. This is a very important result with <em> lots</em> of practical applications. For example, this is the reason
why ice is so good at cooling your drink; it isn't the low <em>temperature</em> of the ice that is important, rather it is the large
amount of energy that the ice absorbs when it melts that does such a
good job of cooling your drink. Phase transitions are used <em>all
the time</em> in cooling and heating applications. A standard air
conditioner or refrigerator typically uses some substance (e.g.,
freon) whose condensation and vaporization play a key role in the
cooling process. And your body uses phase transitions to keep cool on
hot summer days. Sweat (water) on your skin vaporizes, and most of
the energy needed for this phase transition comes from your body.
This is how you can manage not to overheat even if the surrounding air
temperature is greater than your body temperature. So, we would all
be dead were it not for phase transitions.

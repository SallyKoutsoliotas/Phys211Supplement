Certain numbers immediately bring to mind thoughts or ideas. For
example, <q>101</q> makes people think of spotted puppies, <q>747</q>
engenders thoughts of large airplanes, <q>911</q> is the number that you
call for an emergency or one of the worst dates in the history of our
country, and <q>42</q> is the answer to the ultimate question of Life,
the Universe and Everything. And if you mention the number <q>1905</q>
to any physicist, he/she will immediately think of the year in which
Albert Einstein published three papers that completely revolutionized
science and fundamentally changed the way in which we view the
universe. The first paper<fn>A. Einstein, Annalen der Physik
  <em>17</em>, 132 (1905).</fn> introduced the idea of photons (particles of
light), an idea which formed one of the cornerstones of quantum
mechanics.<fn>Interestingly, even though any one of these papers
  would be a monumental lifetime achievement for any mere mortal
  physicist, Einstein received the Nobel prize in physics only for his
  work on photons.</fn> (You will learn about this next semester in PHYS
212.) The second paper<fn>A. Einstein, Annalen der Physik <em>    17</em>, 549 (1905).</fn> was the first to connect molecular diffusion
<mdash /> spreading of an impurity in a motionless fluid <mdash /> with random
Brownian motion of the individual impurity molecules, which is regarded
as the first demonstration of the existence of atoms.

The third paper had a innocuous title: <q>On the electrodynamics of
moving bodies.</q><fn>A. Einstein, Annalen der Physik <em>17</em>,
  891 (1905).</fn> But there is nothing even remotely innocuous about the
implications of the theory, now known as Einstein's Special Theory of
Relativity (<q>special relativity</q> for short), presented in that
paper. Einstein's theory completely changed our conceptions of time
and distance<fn><ellipsis /> and, in fact, establishes that they are
  profoundly related, as we shall see.</fn> and of energy and
matter.<fn><ellipsis /> and, in fact, establishes that they are
  profoundly related, as we shall see.</fn> The theory also led to an
explanation of how stars generate light <mdash /> the fundamental source of
energy in the universe without which life on this planet would not be
possible <mdash /> and led to the Earth-shattering (almost literally,
unfortunately) development of nuclear weapons. The theory also holds
the key to the future development of non-fossil fuel energy sources.
Simply put, you cannot understand how the universe works without
studying Einstein's theory of relativity.

<p>
This chapter and the following three introduce the main ideas and
implications of the Special Theory of Relativity, which applies to the
motion of objects in <em>inertial</em> (non-accelerating, or <q>free
float</q><fn>Taylor and Wheeler, <em>Spacetime Physics</em>, 2<m>^{
    nd}</m> Edition, (Freeman, 1992), p.<nbsp />26.</fn>) reference frames. At the
end of the semester, we will also briefly discuss Einstein's General
Theory of Relativity (<q>general relativity</q> for short), which expands
the theory to account for the effects of acceleration and
gravitational fields.

<problem xml:id="prob_alpha_centauri2">
<statement>
<p>
Another spaceship crew wants to make the trip from Earth to
Proxima Centauri in only 2.0 years as measured by clocks on board their
spaceship. (Recall from the previous problem statement that the
distance between Earth and Proxima Centauri is <m>4.0\units{lt-yr}</m>

Hint: First, do both parts a) and b) together. Also, you will need
to express the speed in terms of the unknown travel time according to
Earth-frame observers.

Betty is standing by the side of a train track when a really
long train approaches traveling at a ridiculously fast speed of <m>0.9c</m>.
Thinking quickly, she pulls out her stopwatch, clicks it on when the
front of the train passes and clicks it off when the back of the train
passes. After standing back up and smoothing down her hair, she notes
that her stopwatch reads <m>0.0025\units{s}</m>. (She has really good reflexes.)
Betty now makes some calculations.
<ol>
<li><p>According to Betty, how long is the moving train?  (Assume
     that she was warned in advance that the train was going at a
     speed <m>0.9c</m>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Later that day (not much later), the train reaches its
     destination and stops.  What is the length of the train according
     to people standing next to the (now motionless) train?</p></li>

A tourist sees the birds pass by while looking at the Big Ben clock tower.
She notes that
a time of <m>12.0\units{ms}</m> elapsed on the clock between the first
bird's passing and the second bird's passing.

<em>Playing Catch on a Train I</em>

You are riding in a box car of a train that is traveling along the tracks
at <m>30\units{m/s}</m>. You are bored, so you start to play catch with
your friend who is standing on the opposite side of the box car, <m>5\units{m}</m>
away from you. You throw the ball at a speed of <m>10\units{m/s}</m>
straight to your friend, who catches the ball; the given speed and direction
are determined in <em>your</em> reference frame. You may ignore any vertical
motion of the ball.

<em>Playing Catch on a Train II</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Note:</em> This is a non-relativistic physics problem.
</p>

<p>
You are riding in a
box car of a train that is traveling along the tracks at an undetermined
speed. Once again, you are bored, so you start to play catch with your
friend who is standing on the opposite side of the box car <m>5\units{m}</m>
away from you. (See figure in previous problem.) You throw the ball
in a horizontal plane at a speed of <m>10\units{m/s}</m> straight to your
friend, who catches the ball. According to an observer on the ground,
the ball travels a distance of <m>13.93\units{m}</m> between the time you
throw it and the time your friend catches it. Calculate the speed of
the train along the tracks.

<em>Photons on a Train</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Note:</em> This is a relativistic physics problem.

<p>
Alice is riding
in a box car of a train that is traveling along the tracks at a speed
<m>v=0.6\units{lt-ns/ns}</m>. She just happens to have a light-clock with her
(just like the one illustrated in Fig. <xref ref="fig_light-clocks"></xref> in <xref ref="chapter_relativityI">Chapter</xref>). Alice aligns the clock so that the light
is aimed horizontally directly across the train car, perpendicular to
the motion of the train. Alice sends a light pulse across the train,
and notices that the light returns to the detector <m>2\units{ns}</m> later.
Alice's friend Bob is standing at rest on the ground as Alice and her
light-clock speed by. Bob measures the round-trip time for the pulse
of light in Alice's light clock to be <m>\Delta t_{ Bob}</m>.
<ol>
<li><p>What is the speed of the light pulse according to Alice?</p></li>
<li><p>Determine the distance between the emitter/detector and the mirror
in the light-clock as determined by Alice.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the speed of the light pulse according to Bob?  (This is
a dumb question in relativistic physics <mdash /> if the answer isn't obvious,
you're thinking too hard!)</p></li>
<li><p>Determine length of the path traversed by the light pulse according
to Bob <em>in terms of the unknown time <m>\Delta t_{ Bob}</m></em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the Pythagorean theorem  to find the distance
traveled by the light pulse according to Bob. From this determine
a numerical value for <m>\Delta t_\text{ Bob }</m>.</p></li>
<li><p>Now use Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_ptr" /> to calculate <m>\Delta t_{ Bob}</m>.
This answer should agree with the answer you determined in the previous
part.</p></li>

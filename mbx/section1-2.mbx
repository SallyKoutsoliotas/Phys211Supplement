<title>Preliminaries</title>
<p>
A few definitions will be useful for the next few chapters.
</p>

<p>
An <em>event</em> is something that happens at a particular
location at a particular time. It is important to be clear about
this, because relativity deals with how different observers measure
distances and times between events. For instance, let's say that the
penguin on top of your television set explodes at 7:12 a.m.<nbsp />on a
Saturday morning. You then run 5 km to a large tower where you
capture (at 7:45 a.m.) a small platypus that inexplicably is dressed like a
secret agent and who is trying to thwart your plans to take over
the Tri-State Area. You could identify two events <mdash /> (1) the
explosion of the penguin and (2) your capture of the semi-aquatic,
egg-laying mammal of action (i.e., the platypus) <mdash /> and say
that these events are separated by 5 km in space and 33 min in time.
Relativity addresses the question of how a different observer measures
the distance and time between the same two events. (Preview: not
everyone will agree about the distance and time between events.)
</p>

<p>
So what do we mean, exactly, by <q>different observers,</q> and what
are the characteristics of these observers that will determine how
their measurements will differ? We start by explaining what is meant
by the term <q>reference frame.</q> You can visualize a reference frame
as a set of rulers (distance measuring devices) and clocks (time
measuring devices) that are arrayed throughout space so that the
position and time of any event can be determined directly. The distinguishing
feature of a reference frame is that the set of <q>rulers</q> and <q>clocks</q>
are all at rest with respect to one another. An observer IN THIS
REFERENCE FRAME is at rest with respect to all the rulers and clocks.
Notice that there can be many observers at different positions
in this reference frame, as long as they are all at rest with respect
to each other and to the measuring tools. All observers in the same
reference frame will agree with each other about the distances and
times between any two events, but they will not agree with observers
in other reference frames moving with respect to their frame.
</p>

<p>
A particularly important kind of reference frame is an <em>inertial reference frame</em>. Observers in an inertial reference
frame experience no significant acceleration, nor can they discern any
gravitational effects. In an ideal inertial reference frame, the
observer would be floating free (hence the name <q>free float</q> that is
sometimes used to discuss an inertial reference frame), because any
non-floating motion would necessarily imply either acceleration or
gravitational effects. To analyze behavior in the vicinity of very
strong gravitational fields, it is necessary to use general
relativity.
</p>

<p>
Technically, an observer is not in a true inertial reference frame if
she is standing on the surface of a planet since there is gravitation.
However, there are plenty of situations where non-inertial effects are
small enough as to be negligible. In fact, the gravitation from a
typical planet is small enough so that the non-inertial effects are
negligible, and Special Relativity works perfectly well. So, for
example, we will often treat observers moving on a constant velocity
train as though they are in an inertial reference frame, even though
there is a small gravitational effect.
</p>

<p>
When dealing with velocities, we have to be careful. A velocity
technically has meaning only if there is a reference. So, for
example, if you are in a car and you are traveling 65 mph toward the
West, you are really traveling 65 mph <em>relative to the
surface of the Earth</em>. In fact, almost any velocity that people
quote in everyday usage is defined relative to the Earth.
</p>

<p>
\begin{boxittext}
{<em>In preparation for class</em>, consider the following question: how
fast are you <em>really</em> going if you are in the car in the previous
paragraph?}
\end{boxittext}
</p>

<p>
Certainly, anyone who is willing to accept a non-geocentric view of
the universe realizes that there is nothing inherently special about
the earth as a reference frame. But scientists have long wondered if
there is some preferred universal reference frame from which all
velocities should be defined, some standard by which we could define
<em>absolute velocities</em> for every object in the universe.
</p>

<p>
In relativity, we will use <em>relative velocities</em>, i.e.,
velocities will always be defined relative to some reference frame.
In fact, one result of relativity is the realization that this is the
best way to define velocity. There is no need to choose any special
reference frame for the universe; all the results of relativity work
perfectly well with velocities measured relative to any reference
frame that you might choose.
</p>

<p>
The following statement applies to relative velocities: if observer A
measures observer B to be moving at a (relative) velocity of <m>\vec{v}</m>
in a particular direction, then B measures A to be moving at a
(relative) velocity of <m>-\vec{v}</m>; i.e., same speed but opposite
direction.

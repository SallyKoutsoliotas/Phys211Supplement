<title>Fundamental Principles of Relativity</title>
<p>
Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity is based on a very simple
premise, namely
</p>

<p>
\begin{boxittext} {<em>The Principle of Relativity</em>: the laws of
physics are the same for observers in different inertial reference
frames.}
\end{boxittext}
</p>

<p>
Let's say, for example, that Michelle sets up a lab in the
basement of Olin Science while Barack sets up an identical lab inside
a truck that is driving on Route 15 with a constant velocity.
Whatever physics equations (including fundamental constants) Michelle
uses to predict and describe the behavior in her lab should work
equally well for Barack in his lab.
</p>

<p>
Not only is this an intuitively reasonable statement, but
the argument can be made that the whole field of physics would be
useless if this statement weren't true (along with chemistry, biology
and engineering as well). After all, what is the point of formulating
a set of laws to describe the universe if they only apply to certain
observers moving in a certain way?
</p>

<p>
The question then boils down to this: what <em>are</em> the fundamental <q>laws
of physics</q> that are the same for all observers? At the beginning of
the 20<m>^{ th}</m> century, there were two main cornerstones of physics:
Newton's Laws of Classical Mechanics, and Maxwell's Equations
describing electrical and magnetic fields. You have already been
introduced to Newton's Laws. We will be discussing
electricity and magnetism in PHYS 212, but here we highlight some of
the ideas relevant to our discussion of relativity.
</p>

<p>
During the 19<m>^{ th}</m> century, there was a tremendous surge of
research to describe electric and magnetic phenomena, culminating in
the integration of electromagnetic theory into a set of four
fundamental laws by James Clerk Maxwell in the late 1800s. Maxwell's
results not only unified electricity and magnetism into a single,
consistent theory, but also showed for the first time that light is an
electromagnetic wave (you'll learn more about this in PHYS 212). The
theory also showed how to produce a wide variety of different types of
electromagnetic waves, a prescription that had been successfully
tested during the period between Maxwell's theory and Einstein's work
on relativity. Suffice it to say that Maxwell's equations were
(and still are) considered by the scientific community to be one of
the cornerstones of physical law.
</p>

<p>
But there was a problem: by the end of the 19<m>^{ th}</m> century, some
theorists
attempted to generalize Maxwell's equations to apply in
any reference frame and found that this could not be done within the
framework of Newtonian Classical Mechanics. There arose
a conflict between the two most widely-accepted cornerstones of
physics: Newton's Mechanics and Maxwell's equations.
</p>

<p>
Here is where Einstein came into the picture. Whereas few people had
previously had any doubts about the validity of Newtonian Mechanics,
Einstein started from the assumption that Maxwell's Equations of
electricity and magnetism were a fundamental law of physics that were
valid in any reference frame, and then set about re-writing Newton's
Laws (generalizing them, actually) to assure that Maxwell's Equations
would be valid in any reference frame. (Hence the title of Einstein's
third paper in 1905.)
</p>

<p>
The argument is actually fairly simple. If Maxwell's Equations are
valid for observers in any inertial reference frame, then not only the
form of the equations but also all the constants should be valid in any
reference frame. Two of the constants in particular <mdash /> the
permittivity of free space <m>\epsilon_0</m>, and the permeability of free
space <m>\mu_0</m> combine to give a value <m>1/\mu_0\epsilon_0 = 9.0\times
10^{16}\units{m</m>^2<m>/s</m>^2<m>}</m>, which is the square of the speed of
light when it propagates through a vacuum! Based on the fundamental
Principle of Relativity (above), the conclusion is staggering. If
Maxwell's equations formulate a fundamental law of physics, then the
Relativity Principle implies the following consequence
<fn>Einstein stated the second postulate slightly differently:  
<q>light is always propagated in empty space with a definite velocity
<em>c</em> which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting
body.</q>  It can be shown that the invariance of the speed of light, 
with respect to the motion of the <em>source</em>, and the invariance of the 
speed of light with respect to the motion of the <em>observer</em>
are simply consequences of each other.</fn>
:
</p>

<p>
\begin{boxittext}
{
<em>The invariance of the speed of light</em>: The speed of light in a vacuum <m>c</m>
is measured to be <m>3.0\times 10^8\units{m/s}</m> by any observer in any inertial
reference frame.
}
\end{boxittext}
</p>

<p>
Although verified experimentally,<fn>In fact, an
  experiment by Michelson and Morly in 1895 already indicated the
  invariance of the speed of light in vacuum.</fn> this statement runs
counter to our intuition, based on common experience. Consider the
following sample problems:
</p>

<example>
<statement>
<p>
{Classical calculation of relative velocities I.}
Karen is running down the hall of Olin with a loaded blow dart gun.
She is running with a constant speed of <m>5\units{m/s}</m> when she sees Brian
and Jeff standing in front of their lab. While still running, she
fires a blow dart in their direction. If the speed of the blow dart
is <m>15\units{m/s}</m> relative to Karen, how fast is the dart moving with
respect to
Jeff and Brian's reference frame? 

<em>Solution: </em> The answer is what you
would think <mdash /> simply add the speeds to find that the blow dart
travels at a speed of <m>20\units{m/s}</m> relative to Jeff and Brian.
</p>
</statement>
</example>

<p>
\begin{exampleb}{Classical calculation of relative velocities II.}
Brian now picks up his blow dart gun and aims it in Karen's
direction. Karen quickly retreats, running away from Brian and Jeff
with a constant speed of <m>5\units{m/s}</m>. Brian fires a dart toward Karen at
a speed <m>15\units{m/s}</m> measured from his reference frame. How fast is the
dart moving with respect to Karen's reference frame? 

<em>Solution: </em> Again, the
result is what you would think <mdash /> simply subtract the speeds to
find that the blow dart travels at a speed <m>10\units{m/s}</m> relative to Karen.
\end{exampleb}
</p>

<p>
\begin{exampleb}{Speeds of light pulses.}
Lord Fa is returning to his home world of Gao. Approaching the
planet at speed of <m>2.0\times 10^8\units{m/s}</m> (relative to the planet), he
sends a beacon of light to Commander Nea stationed on Gao. This
pulse of light leaves his ship with a speed <m>3.0\times 10^8\units{m/s}</m>
relative to the ship. How fast is the pulse moving relative to
Commander Nea? 

<em>Solution: </em> Classically, you should expect that
Commander Nea would view the pulse as moving with a speed of
<m>5.0\times 10^8\units{m/s}</m>. But this is wrong. Instead, from her
reference frame, the pulse is moving with a speed of <m>3.0\times
  10^8\units{m/s}</m>! That's just the way it is with light pulses moving in a
vacuum <mdash /> everyone measures the same speed of <m>3.0\times 10^8\units{m/s}</m>,
regardless of their motion.
\end{exampleb}
</p>

<p>
You should find the results of the above example to be strange <mdash />
there is nothing in our everyday experience that would lead us to
expect such a result. But numerous experiments have measured the
speed of light in a wide variety of reference frames, and the
results always agree with the statement of the invariance of <m>c</m>.
</p>

<p>
That the speed of light (in empty space) does not depend on the speed
of its source has been demonstrated so convincingly and the value of
the speed measured so accurately that the value is now defined to be
exactly <m>299,792,458\units{m/s}</m>. By combining this definition of <m>c</m> with the
definition of the second (in terms of an atomic clock), we no longer
need an independent definition of the meter.

<title>Length contraction</title>
<p>
One thing that will come up repeatedly in this unit is the fact that
relativity breaks down the distinction between distance and time. In
fact, in relativity, distance and time are really just flip sides of
the same coin. And as we will see now, you can't change our
conception of time without making a similarly dramatic change in the
way we view distances and length.
</p>

<p>
Consider the following thought experiment: a train is moving on a
track, with Observers A and B at the front and back end of the train.
A and B have measured the length of the train with a long tape measure
that they carry with them on the moving train, and find the length to
be <m>L_{ train}</m>. The train goes past Observer C who is standing
next to the track with a stopwatch (see Fig. <xref ref="fig_contraction"></xref>).
Relative to C in the <q>ground reference frame,</q> the train is moving
with a speed <m>v</m>. From the train's reference frame, of course, it is
C and the ground that are moving at a speed <m>v</m> in the opposite
direction.

<p>
Let's say that Observer C wants to measure the length of the train.
He can use his stopwatch to do this: since distance = (speed) <times />
(time), the length of the train is simply the speed <m>v</m> times the time
interval between when the front of the train passes and when the back
of the train passes. Let's consider two events: Event A <m>=</m> front of
train passes C; Event B <m>=</m> back of train passes C. According to
people on the train, the time between the two events <m>\Delta t_{
  train} = L_{ train}/v</m>, where <m>L_{ train}</m> is the
previously-measured length of the train <mdash /> this is how far Observer C
moves between the events according to train observers. But, as we saw
in the previous section, C measures the proper time (since this
observer is at both events), which is a smaller time interval:
<men>
  \Delta t_C = \Delta t_{ proper} = \Delta t_{ train}\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}.
</men>
</p>

<p>
Based on this result, Observer C now says that the length of the train is
<md>
  <mrow>  \text{ Length }  = (\text{ speed } )\times (\text{ time } ) \amp = v\Delta t_C \nonumber</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp =  v \Delta t_{ train}\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}  \nonumber</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp = L_{ train}\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}.</mrow>
</md>
</p>

<p>
<em><em>The length of the train as measured by an observer by the
side of the track is less than the length of the same train as
measured by people moving with the train.</em></em>
</p>

<p>
We can write this relation (referred to as the <em><em>Lorentz
contraction</em></em> or simply <em><em>length contraction</em></em> equation) in
more general terms:
</p>

<p>
\begin{boxiteq}
{
<men xml:id="eq_lengthcontract" >
  L_{ other} = L_{ rest}\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2},
</men>
</p>

<p>
}
\end{boxiteq}
</p>

<p>
where <m>L_{ rest}</m> is the length of an object as measured by
observers in a reference frame where that object is at rest, and
<m>L_{ other}</m> is the length as measured by observers in a different
reference frame. Note that an object is always largest when viewed
from its own reference frame, and shrinks when it is viewed as moving.
</p>

<p>
Some comments are in order:
<ul>
<li><p>You can't have time dilation without length contraction <mdash /> the 
two necessarily go hand-in-hand.  This is a recurring theme of relativity <mdash />
Einstein's theory can't be taken <q>a la carte</q>; rather, it is all or nothing.
Einstein realized that if any single prediction of relativity were
ever refuted, then the entire theory would have to be discarded.</p></li>
<li><p>The arguments in this section apply to length components along
the direction of the relative motion.  Components of a length in 
directions perpendicular to the relative motion are not contracted.</p></li>
<li><p>Length contraction is not an illusion or merely a matter of
perception.  In the example, the train doesn't just appear to be
smaller from C's reference frame; rather, it  <em>really is
smaller</em> in that reference frame.  Some of the homework problems and
drill questions will investigate some of the curious properties of
length contraction.</p></li>

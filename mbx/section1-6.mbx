<title>Experimental evidence</title>
<p>
Most people are skeptical when they first read about the predictions
of special relativity. This is to be expected, since we do not
experience time dilation or length contraction effects on a daily
basis. For these effects to be significant, you need relative
velocities that are significant fractions of the speed of light.
Looking at both Eqs.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_ptr" /> and <xref ref="eq_lengthcontract" />, the
key piece is the stretch factor <m>\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}</m>, which is almost
identically equal to 1.00 for even the fastest velocities that people
ever experience. This is an important aspect of relativity;
namely, that it obeys classical correspondence, i.e., the results of
relativity agree with Newton's classical results for smaller
velocities.
</p>

<p>
Despite the fact that relativistic effects are almost negligible in
the <q>everyday</q> phenomena of our personal experience, there is
copious experimental evidence
that shows that Einstein's predictions are correct. In every case
where an experiment has tested the theory of relativity, the
experimental results have always agreed precisely with the predictions
of relativity. Some examples:
<ul>
<li><p><em>Time dilation</em>.  Time dilation is the most tested aspect of
relativity.  The most direct test was performed by taking two
identical atomic clocks, flying one around the world on a plane and
leaving the other on the ground, then comparing their readings after
the trip.  As predicted by Einstein, the clocks had ticked off
different times, and by precisely the predicted amount.<fn>Note
that General Relativity plays a role here because the height of a
clock also affects its rate, but the experiments took account of these
general relativistic effects.</fn> Particle decay has also been used to
test time dilation: a type of particle that typically lives for a
certain period of time has been shown to live significantly longer if
accelerated to high speeds (relative to the ground); again, the
difference in times agrees perfectly with relativity.  And the Global
Positioning System (GPS) <mdash /> which involves a series of satellites
with precise clocks <mdash /> uses relativity extensively to keep the
orbiting clocks synchronized with those in the GPS units on the Earth.
Without relativistic corrections, GPS wouldn't work!</p></li>
<li><p><em>The speed of light as a speed limit.</em>  This result is verified
daily in particle accelerators.  It is fairly straightforward for
scientists to accelerate subatomic particles to speeds close to the
speed of light.  But no matter how much energy is added, the speeds
never make it to or above <m>c</m>.  Electrons, in particular, have been
accelerated to speeds <m>u> 0.99999999999c</m>, but never up to or above <m>c</m>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Length contraction.</em>  No experimentalist has managed to
accelerate a train to relative speeds large enough to measure length
contraction effects.  (Trust us: you wouldn't want to be anywhere near
a train going this fast.)  But there is experimental evidence for
length contraction: (a) cosmic rays produced at the top of the Earth's
atmosphere somehow manage to make it to the surface of the Earth
before decaying, despite the fact that they are very unstable.  Some
of these particles have lifetimes so short that even traveling at
speeds close to <m>c</m>, they would be expected to decay long before they
reach the ground.  This can be explained using length contraction: the
distance from the top of the atmosphere to the Earth's surface is
significantly contracted from their reference frame, so there is no
problem making it to the Earth's surface before
decaying.<fn>This result can also be explained using time
dilation, of course, because time dilation and length contraction are
really different aspects of the same phenomenon.</fn> (b) Another piece of
experimental evidence comes from electromagnetic theory <mdash /> it turns out
that you can explain why an electrical current produces magnetic
effects by applying relativistic length contraction to the stream of
electrons.  The argument is too long to present here (especially since
we haven't covered electricity and magnetism yet), but suffice it to
say that the results agree perfectly with an analysis based on length
contraction.</p></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
There are other experimental tests of other aspects of relativity,
some of which will be discussed later in this unit (when those aspects
are presented). But, in general, it is worth remembering that
relativity is not a series of different theories, but rather is a
single, coherent, internally consistent theory. All of the
predictions are inherently related to each other. So you can't say,
<q>Well, I'm fine with time dilation but I don't buy length
contraction.</q> You simply can't have time dilation without length
contraction <mdash /> they are the same thing. So even if there hadn't been
any independent experimental evidence of length contraction (which
there is) there would be very little doubt of its veracity since time
dilation has been verified extensively.

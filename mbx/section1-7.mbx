<title>Units and dimensionless velocities</title>
<p>
When working with relativity, it is convenient to express lengths in
terms of distance traveled by light in one unit of time. A <q>light
year</q> for instance is the distance that light travels in one year.
An analogy would be to say that the distance between here and New York
City is <q>three car hours</q> (i.e., it takes 3 hours to get to New York
in a car driving at highway speeds). In fact, you will often hear
people using time directly to express a distance: <q>Oh, it's 3 hours
to New York City from here.</q> We will abbreviate these units as lt-s,
lt-min, lt-yr, <ellipsis /> for light-second, light-minute and light-year,
respectively. Using these units for distance, we can express speeds in
terms of lt-s/s, lt-min/min, lt-yr/yr, etc. Since the speed of light
<m>c = 1 \units{lt-s/s} = 1 \units{lt-min/min} = 1 \units{lt-yr/yr} =
\dots</m>, the speed of a particle in these units is simply the speed
expressed as a fraction of the speed of light.

<example>
<statement>
<p>
{Units Conversion from lt-s/s to m/s}
A proton is traveling at a speed of <m>0.25\units{lt-s/s}</m>. Find its speed in
units of m/s. 

<em>Solution: </em> Use the fact that <m>1\units{lt-s/s}</m> is equal to
about <m>3.00\times 10^8\units{m/s}</m>. Then convert units in the
usual way:
<me>
  0.25\units{lt-s/s} \times 
        \frac{3.0\times 10^8\units{m/s}}{1\units{lt-s/s}}
       = 0.75\times 10^8\units{m/s}.
</me>
</p>

<p>
In this example, a particle has a speed <m>u = 0.25\units{lt-s/s}</m>. This same
speed could be expressed as <m>u = 0.25c</m>. In fact, we will typically
express velocities as a fraction of the speed of light <m>c</m>.

frames of reference? Explain.

<statement>
<p>
A simple way of synchronizing two clocks at rest relative to one
another is to stand exactly halfway between them and emit light pulses
toward each of them at the same instant of time. Each clock is then
set to 0 when the synchronizing pulse reaches it.
<ol>
<li><p>How does this scheme ensure that the clocks are started
    simultaneously?</p></li>
<li><p>On a spacetime diagram show the world lines of two
    clocks at rest in the unprimed frame of reference at <m>x = 0</m> and at <m>x =
    L</m>, along with the world lines of two synchronizing light pulses that
    start from the midpoint and reach each of the two clocks at <m>t = 0.</m></p></li>

For <xref ref="example_simultaneity">Example</xref> in the text, show from
the spacetime diagram in Fig. <xref ref="fig_simultaneity"></xref> that lightning
hit the front of the train at a negative value of <m>t^\prime</m>, but that
lightning hit the rear of the train at a positive value of <m>t^\prime</m>.
Use the rule for finding the <m>t^\prime</m> coordinate of an event to
solve this problem. [Hint: you might want to extend some of the axes
in the negative direction.]

<problem xml:id="prob_farmer">
<statement>
<p>
Farmer Brown, at rest in his frame, carries a ladder through
a barn. According to Farmer Brown, the ladder measures
<m>20\units{lt-ns}</m>. According to observers at rest with respect
to the barn, Farmer Brown and his ladder are moving at a
speed <m>0.80c</m> (alternately, Farmer Brown sees the barn
moving at speed <m>0.80c</m>). In the barn's frame, the
front door of the barn is at <m>x = 0 \units{lt-ns}</m> and the back
door is at <m>x = 16\units{lt-ns}</m>.
<ol>
<li><p>Calculate the length of the ladder as measured by
observers in the barn's reference frame.  According to
these observers, will the ladder fit within the barn?</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate the length of the barn as measured by
Farmer Brown.  According to Farmer Brown, will the ladder
fit within the barn?</p></li>
<li><p>Draw a careful spacetime plot for this situation,
with appropriate tick marks on the axes (labeled with
numbers).  Starting with the barn frame, draw world
lines for the entrance and exit of the barn (i.e., the
front and back doors).  Draw also world lines for the front and
back of the ladder (which is moving as viewed in the
barn frame).  The distance between the front and back of
the ladder in your plot should agree with your answer
to part (a), and the slopes of these lines should be
consistent with the known velocities.</p></li>
<li><p>Label the following events on your diagram:
A = front of ladder enters the barn; B = front of ladder
leaves the barn; C = back of ladder enters barn;
D = back of ladder leaves barn.  Determine the order
of these events in time as viewed from the barn's
reference frame.  Is this result consistent with your
answer to (a), i.e., whether or not the ladder fits in the
barn, according to barn-frame observers?  (Consider
whether the back of the ladder enters the barn before
or after the front of the ladder leaves the barn.)</p></li>
<li><p>Determine the order of events A, B, C and D as
viewed from Farmer Brown's reference frame.  Is this
result consistent with your answers to (b)?</p></li>
<li><p>Based on your answers for this problem, can you
see how relativistic time-ordering (i.e, the fact that
different observers do not necessarily agree on the
ordering of events in time) is necessarily linked with
length contraction?</p></li>

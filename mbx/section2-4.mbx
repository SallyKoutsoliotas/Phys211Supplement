<title>Ordering of events <mdash /> the 
relativity of simultaneity</title>
<p>
Every event has a set of space and time coordinates. In <xref ref="example_causality-intervals-diagram">Example</xref> above, we would say that the
event A (girl sneezes) occurs at time <m>t=0</m> and location <m>x =
1.3\units{lt-s}</m>. Similarly, we can determine the location and times
of events B and C, all as measured by observers in the Earth-Moon
reference frame. Let's add one more event to the scenario: let's say
that at time <m>t=0</m>, the pitcher Masahiro Tanaka, Jr., pitches the ball
toward Castro. In Fig. <xref ref="fig_father-daughter"></xref> we have added this event and
labeled it P. In the Earth-Moon frame, we can say quite definitively
that A and P are simultaneous and come first, then B, then C. Also, A
and C happen at the same location, and P and B happen at the same
location.

<p>
Special relativity helps us answer the following question: how does an
observer moving in a different reference frame view these same events? We
won't worry here about the actual numerical values of <m>x^\prime</m> and
<m>t^\prime</m> (the position and time as measured by a different observer), but
we can say quite a lot about the ordering of events in space and time
by looking at the spacetime diagrams.
</p>

<p>
We have added another world line to Fig. <xref ref="fig_father-daughter"></xref>,
namely, the world line for a hypothetical alien whizzing past the
Earth just as the pitch is thrown. This alien is monitoring the game
to try to understand human culture. We assume the alien is traveling
at a speed <m>0.5c</m>; hence, the world line has a slope of 2.
</p>

<p>
We have already commented that the world line of an observer in a
primed frame is simply the <m>t^\prime</m> axis for that frame, so we have
labeled the alien's world line <m>t^\prime</m>. But where should we put the
<m>x^\prime</m>-axis and what scale should we put on it? It turns out that to
satisfy the invariance of the speed of light, we must draw the
<m>x^\prime</m>-axis at the same angle relative to the <m>x</m>-axis as the angle of
the <m>t^\prime</m>-axis relative to the <m>t</m>-axis. This means the slope of the
<m>x^\prime</m>-axis is equal to the speed <m>v</m> of the primed frame relative to the
unprimed frame.
</p>

<p>
Recall that the <m>t^\prime</m>-axis represents points where <m>x^\prime =
0</m>. It turns out that <m>x^\prime</m> is constant along any line parallel
to the <m>t^\prime</m>-axis. In other words, lines parallel to the <m>t^\prime</m>-axis
are equal-location lines for the primed frame of reference, just as
the <m>t</m>-axis and all lines parallel to it are each lines of equal
location for the unprimed frame of reference. The same ideas work for
events on lines parallel to the <m>x</m> or <m>x^\prime</m> axes; events on a line
parallel to the <m>x</m>-axis are simultaneous in the unprimed frame, and
events on a line parallel to the <m>x^\prime</m>-axis are simultaneous in the
primed reference frame.
</p>

<p>
We can use these ideas to <q>read off</q> coordinates for events in
both reference frames. As an example, let's look at event C in
Fig. <xref ref="fig_father-daughter"></xref>. We have already commented that in the
unprimed frame, its <m>x</m> location is <m>1.3\units{lt-s}</m> and its time
is <m>2\units{s}</m>. The coordinates of this event in the alien's
reference frame are determined by drawing lines parallel to the
<m>x^\prime</m> and <m>t^\prime</m> axes (shown as dotted lines in
Fig. <xref ref="fig_father-daughter"></xref>). The intersections of these
construction lines with the opposing primed axis gives the <m>x_C</m> and
<m>t_C</m> coordinates. The rules for determining coordinates can be
summarized as follows:
<ol>
<li><p>To find <m>x_C</m>, draw a straight line through C parallel to the
<m>t</m>-axis and read off where it crosses the <m>x</m>-axis.</p></li>
<li><p>To find <m>t_C</m> draw a straight line through C parallel to the
<m>x</m>-axis and read off where it crosses the <m>t</m>-axis.</p></li>
<li><p>To find <m>x_C^\prime</m>, draw a straight line through C parallel to
the <m>t^\prime</m>-axis and read off where it crosses the <m>x^\prime</m>-axis.</p></li>
<li><p>To find <m>t_C^\prime</m>, draw a straight line through C parallel to the
<m>x^\prime</m>-axis and read off where it crosses the <m>t^\prime</m>-axis.</p></li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Using this type of construction, we can see that although events A and
C occur at the same place in the unprimed (Earth-Moon) reference
frame, event C happens to the left of the event A in the primed
(alien) reference frame. This is easy to understand: the alien is far
from the Moon when event A happens, so A is far <q>to the right,</q>
whereas the alien is close to the Moon when event C happens, so from
the alien's perspective, C isn't so far to the right, i.e.,
smaller <m>x^\prime</m> coordinate.
</p>

<p>
But what about the ordering of events in time? We have commented
that the invariance of the spacetime interval says that if two
observers disagree about distances, then they will have to disagree
about time intervals as well.
</p>
<aside>
<p>
{<em>In preparation for class:</em> Look at the <m>t^\prime</m> coordinates for events
P and A. In the Earth-Moon reference frame, these events are simultaneous.
What about in the alien reference frame?
}
</p>
</aside>
<p>
We have said that any two events on a line parallel to the
<m>x^\prime</m>-axis are simultaneous in the primed frame of reference.
Similarly two events that lie on a line parallel to the <m>x</m>-axis are
simultaneous in the unprimed frame. However two different events
cannot lie both on a line parallel to the <m>x</m>-axis and parallel to the
<m>x^\prime</m>-axis. Thus two events that are simultaneous in one frame cannot
be simultaneous in the other frame. We explore this idea in the
following example.
</p>

<example xml:id="example_simultaneity">
<statement>
<p>
{Simultaneity is Relative}
Einstein showed, with the following thought experiment, that two events
which occur at the same time but at different places in one frame,
occur at different times in another frame.

<p>
Imagine a train moving past a station. By chance, lightning
happens to strike the front and back of the train at the same time
according to observers on the station platform. Light pulses from
these strikes travel toward the middle of the train, where a passenger
observes their times of arrival. Do the light pulses arrive
simultaneously or does one arrive before the other, and if so, which
one?


<em>Solution: </em>
Use a spacetime diagram, Fig. <xref ref="fig_simultaneity"></xref>, with the
station at rest in the unprimed frame and the train at rest in the
primed frame. The <m>x</m>- and <m>x^\prime</m>-axes both lie along the track.
(Note: this does <em>not</em> mean that the <m>x</m>- and <m>x^\prime</m>-axes
are the same thing on a spacetime plot. The <m>x^\prime</m>-axis is not
shown in Fig. <xref ref="fig_simultaneity"></xref>, but remember that it is the mirror
image of the <m>t^\prime</m>-axis about a <m>45^\circ</m> line; i.e., the angle
between the <m>t</m>- and <m>t^\prime</m>-axes is the same as the angle between
the <m>x</m>- and <m>x^\prime</m>-axes.)
The world line for the middle of the station is shown as the <m>t</m>-axis.
</p>

<p>
Because all parts of the train are at rest in the primed frame, we
draw the world lines for the front and the rear ends of the train
parallel to the <m>t^\prime</m>-axis. Also, in
Fig. <xref ref="fig_simultaneity"></xref>, we have chosen the world line for the
passenger riding in the exact middle of the train to be the
<m>t^\prime</m>-axis. In the primed frame the front and rear world lines
are then equidistant from the passenger, by definition.
</p>

<p>
The lightning strikes occur at points R and F on the world lines of
the rear and front of the train. Because each strike represents an
event and because these two events occur simultaneously in the
station frame, R and F must be drawn on the same horizontal line.
We arbitrarily choose this line to be at <m>t = 0</m>.
</p>

<p>
The light pulses produced by the lightning strikes travel with speed
<m>c = 1\units{lt-whatever per whatever}</m> from the event F back toward
the passenger and from R forward toward the passenger. The pulse from
F is represented by a world line of slope <m>-1</m> and the pulse from R is
represented by a world line of slope <m>+1</m>. <xref ref="fig_simultaneity">Figure</xref> shows that the pulse from F arrives at the
passenger's world line (at F<m>^\prime</m>) earlier (i.e., at a smaller
value of <m>t^\prime</m>) than does the pulse from R, which arrives at
R<m>^\prime</m>.
</p>

<p>
The passenger must conclude that the front strike occurred before
the rear strike because she is sitting in the middle of the train,
equidistant from R and F, and she knows the light pulses must have
taken the same time (in her frame) to reach her. By the same
argument, an observer on the station platform who was at the exact
middle of the train at <m>t = 0</m> when the strikes occurred, sees the
pulses at the same time. This is shown on the spacetime diagram
by the fact that the world lines of the pulses cross the world line of
the middle of the station at <m>x = 0</m> (event M) at the same time.

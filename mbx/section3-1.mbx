<title>Introduction</title>
<p>
So far in our discussions of relativity, we have taken a very simple
principle <mdash /> the <em>Principle of Relativity</em>, which states that the
laws of physics are the same for observers in any inertial reference
frame <mdash /> and have used this principle to change completely our notions
of how time and space work. But we are not yet done looking at the
implications of this principle. It will be necessary to generalize
the classical relations for energy and momentum to account for the
strange behavior that we have already seen at relativistic velocities.
And the new relativistic equations for energy and momentum carry
significant implications that change our notions of energy and matter.
This discussion leads to what is probably the most famous equation in
all of physics <mdash /> namely <m>E = mc^2</m> <mdash /> as well as the basic principle
behind nuclear power generation. Of course, this is also the principle
behind nuclear weapons, so it can be argued that this result fundamentally
changed society. But this is also the principle behind energy generation
in stars (including our own Sun); there would be no life on this planet
without this principle.

But before we discuss relativistic energy and momentum, we will take
a closer look at the concept of velocity. If observers in different
reference frames don't agree on the results of measurement of lengths
and time intervals, they won't agree on the results of their determinations
of velocities.

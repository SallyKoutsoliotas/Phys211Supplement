<title>Relativistic Velocity Transformations</title>
<p>
Let's say that two spaceships leave Earth. The <em>USS Zaphod</em>
leaves the Earth going in one direction with a speed <m>0.8c</m> relative
to Earth. The <em>USS Beeblebrox</em> leaves Earth going in the opposite
direction with a speed <m>0.8c</m> relative to Earth. What is the speed
of the <em>Zaphod</em> from the reference frame of the <em>Beeblebrox</em>?
Based on classical assumptions, you might expect the answer to be
<m>1.6c</m>. But this conflicts with Einstein's theory of relativity which
states that no object can travel faster than the speed of light
relative to any other observer. It is clear that it is necessary to
replace classical laws for addition and subtraction of velocities with
a more general, relativistic transformation.
</p>

<p>
A relativistic approach to velocity addition and subtraction was already
hinted at earlier in <xref ref="chapter_relativityI">Chapter</xref>. The principle
of invariance of the speed of light requires that all observers (in
any reference frame) measure the same speed for a pulse of light <mdash />
we can't simply add and subtract velocities. On the other hand, common
experience shows us that for non-relativistic speeds, simple addition
and subtraction work fine. So, we need a velocity transformation
relation that reduces to the classical result for small speeds, but
which prevents anything from traveling faster than the speed of light.
It turns out that this can be accomplished by taking the classical result
and dividing by a relativistic correction that becomes significant (i.e.,
not just 1) for speeds close to <m>c</m>.
</p>

<p>
<xref ref="fig_rel1_vtransform">Figure</xref> shows the scenario that we are
discussing. Two reference frames are defined: an unprimed frame
denoted by observer A and a primed frame denoted by observer B on a
spaceship moving with a speed <m>v</m> relative to observer A. They are both
measuring the speed of the same object. Observer A says the object is
moving with a speed <m>u_{ obj}</m> while observer B says the ball is
moving with a speed <m>u_{ obj}^\prime</m>.
</p>

<m>u_{ obj}^\prime</m> from the reference frame of observer<nbsp />B.</caption>

</figure>
<p>
The question is: How are <m>u_{ obj}</m>, <m>u^\prime_{ obj}</m> and <m>v</m> related?
The answer is given by a <em>velocity transformation</em> equation,
</p>

<p>
\begin{boxiteq}
{
<men xml:id="eq_vtransform" >
  u_{ obj} = \frac{u_{ obj}^\prime + v}{1 + u_{ obj}^\prime v/c^2}.
</men>
</p>

<p>
}
\end{boxiteq}
</p>

<p>
Equation <xref ref="eq_vtransform" /> is used to relate an object's
velocity in one frame to that as viewed in another frame.
</p>

<p>
We won't derive Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_vtransform" /> rigorously here. Rather,
note that if the object is a pulse of light, then <m>u_{ obj}^\prime
= c</m>, and Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_vtransform" /> reduces to
<men>
  u_{ obj} = \frac{c+v}{1 + cv/c^2} = \frac{c+v}{1+v/c} = 
c\left(\frac{c+v}{c+v}\right) = c.
</men>
</p>

<p>
Both observers measure the object to have a speed <m>c</m>, so, the
invariance of the speed of light is preserved in this transformation.
</p>

<p>
Note that the numerator in Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_vtransform" /> is the result
that you would get classically, whereas the denominator is a
relativistic correction. Also, note that if either the object or the
primed observer are traveling at speeds that aren't a significant
fraction of the speed of light, then the denominator of
Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_vtransform" /> is very nearly 1, so we recover the
classical result for <q>everyday</q> speeds.
</p>

<p>
We'll show how to work with this relation in the next example.
</p>

<example>
<statement>
<p>
{Baseball velocity addition}
Bucknell Bison baseball pitcher Christy Mathewson throws a blazing
fastball while riding on a really fast train.
From his reference frame (i.e., the train's frame) the ball moves
toward the front of the train with a speed <m>u_{ ball} = 0.7c</m>.
The train itself is moving relative to the ground with speed <m>v =
  0.8c</m>. How fast is the ball moving relative to someone on the
ground?
</p>

<p>
<em>Solution: </em> Classically, the speed as viewed from the ground
would be <m>u_{ ball} + v</m> or <m>1.5c</m>. (This is the numerator of
Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_vtransform" />.) But, of course, this isn't possible in
a relativistic universe where nothing goes faster than <m>c</m>. Using
Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_vtransform" /> we find
<men>
  u_{ ball} = \frac{u_{ ball}^\prime + v}{1+ u_{ ball}^\prime v/c^2}
  = \frac{0.7c + 0.8c}{1+0.7\times 0.8} = 0.96c.
</men>
</p>

<p>
Note that relativistic correction keeps the speed less than <m>c</m>.
</p>

<p>
<em>Exercise</em>: What if the ball were a beam of light? How
fast would it be moving from the train's reference frame? How fast
from the ground's reference frame? Show that
Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_vtransform" /> gives the correct result for this case.
</p>
</statement>
</example>

<p>
If the problem gives you the speed as measured by the unprimed observer,
you can use the following inverse transformations to get the speed as
measured by the primed observer:
</p>

<p>
\begin{boxiteq}
{
<men xml:id="eq_vtransform-inverse" >
  u_{ obj}^\prime = \frac{u_{ obj}- v}{1 - u_{ obj} v/c^2}.
</men>
</p>

<p>
}
\end{boxiteq}
</p>

<p>
You don't really need to write down these relations or try to figure
out which speed is <m>v</m>, which speed is <m>u_{ obj}</m>, and which speed
is <m>u_{ obj}^\prime</m>. There is a very simple way of handling all
of these problems. No matter which velocity you are looking for, the
answer is always:
<men>
  \frac{\text{ classical result } }{\text{ relativistic correction } }, \nonumber
</men>
where the relativistic correction is simply <q><m>1+</m>(product of other two
speeds divided by <m>c^2</m>)</q> or <q><m>1-</m>(product of other two speeds divided
by <m>c^2</m>).</q>. You will be given two velocities, and you'll be looking
for the third one. Just figure out the answer classically, then divide
by the correction. The only question then is whether to use the <q><m>+</m></q>
or <q><m>-</m></q> in the correction. The rule: if you <em>added</em> magnitudes of
velocities in the numerator, then you use the <q><m>+</m></q> in the denominator,
and if you <em>subtracted</em> magnitudes in the numerator, then you use the
<q><m>-</m></q> in the denominator. This will take care of any velocity addition
or subtraction that you need.

<title>New definitions for energy and momentum</title>
<p>
You have learned previously that in interactions among low velocity
particles in which the only forces are the interparticle forces
(i.e.<nbsp />no <em>external</em> forces), the total momentum <m>\sum_i
m_i\vec{u}_i</m> and the total mass <m>\sum_i m_i</m> are conserved. (As in
<xref ref="chapter_relativistic_spacetime">Chapter</xref>, we use the symbol <m>u</m> to
refer to the velocity of some particle as viewed from a reference
frame, reserving <m>v</m> for the velocity of the reference frame itself.)
For example, when particle 1 collides with particle 2 and particles 3,
4, and 5 emerge from the point of collision, we have two conservation
laws:
<men xml:id="eq_pcons" >
  \vec{p}_1 +\vec{p}_2 = \vec{p}_3 +\vec{p}_4 +\vec{p}_5
</men>
and
<men xml:id="eq_mcons" >
  m_1 + m_2 = m_3 + m_4 + m_5 
   \text{\hspace{0.2in}\textbf{Caution: Only valid classically!}}
</men>
</p>

<p>
After Einstein discovered the velocity transformation law,
Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_vtransform" /> and <xref ref="eq_vtransform-inverse" />, he
recognized that the classical definition of momentum (<m>\vec{p} =
m\vec{u}</m>) was incompatible with Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_pcons" /> and the Relativity
Principle. That is, for a given collision, classical momentum could
be conserved in one frame but not another. An example will illustrate
this:
</p>

<example xml:id="ex_momentum-goodbye">
<statement>
<p>
{Say goodbye to the classical expression for momentum.} (For this example, we use the natural units of MeV, MeV/<m>c</m>, MeV/<m>c^2</m>
and <m>c</m>. More detail on these units appears <xref ref="section_rel-units">section</xref>.) <xref ref="fig_momentum_goodbye">Figure</xref> shows a
particle of mass <m>9\units{MeV/</m>c^2<m>}</m> and speed <m>0.8c</m> striking a
stationary particle of mass <m>5 \units{MeV/</m>c^2<m>}</m>, producing a
single particle. (a) Calculate the mass and speed of the single
particle after the collision. (b) Show that classical momentum is
<em>not</em> conserved in the frame in which the final particle is at
rest.

<em>Solution: </em>
The classical laws Eqs.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_pcons" /> and <xref ref="eq_mcons" /> would
yield
<md>
  <mrow>  \text{ Eq.~(3.3.1) } \amp \Rightarrow\amp  9\units{MeV/$c^2$}\times 0.8c + 
                     5\units{MeV/$c^2$}\times 0 = m_3u_3 \nonumber</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp \Rightarrow\amp  u_3 = \frac{7.2\units{MeV/$c$}}
                            {14\units{MeV/$c^2$}} = 0.514c\nonumber</mrow>
</md>
and
<md>
  <mrow>  \text{ Eq.~(3.3.2) } 
\amp \Rightarrow\amp  9\units{MeV/$c^2$} + 
                     5\units{MeV/$c^2$} = m_3 \nonumber</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp \Rightarrow\amp  m_3 = 14\units{MeV/$c^2$}. \nonumber</mrow>
</md>
</p>

<p>
Transform now to a frame in which the final particle is at rest. This
clearly means that we should view the collision from a spaceship
traveling with particle 3 at <m>0.514c</m> to the right, relative to the
original observer. Equation<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_vtransform-inverse" /> gives
<md>
  <mrow>  u_3^\prime \amp =\amp  \frac{u_3 - v}{1 - u_3v/c^2} = 
              \frac{0.514c - 0.514c}{1-0.514^2} = 0 \nonumber</mrow>
  <mrow>  u_5^\prime \amp =\amp  \frac{u_5 - v}{1 - u_5v/c^2} = 
              \frac{0-0.514c}{1-0\times 0.514} = -0.514c \nonumber</mrow>
  <mrow>  u_9^\prime \amp =\amp  \frac{u_9 - v}{1 - u_9v/c^2} = 
              \frac{0.8c - 0.514c}{1-0.8\times0.514} = 0.486c \nonumber</mrow>
</md>

</figure>
<p>
In the new primed frame, the collision appears as in
Fig. <xref ref="fig_momentum_goodbyeII"></xref>. Checking the classical momentum
conservation law in the new frame gives
<men>
  9\units{MeV/$c^2$}\times 0.486c + 5\units{MeV/$c^2$}\times (-0.514c) = 
   m_3 \times 0.
</men>
</p>

<p>
But the left side of this equation here works out to be
<m>1.80\units{MeV/</m>c<m>}</m> which is NOT equal to the right side (which is
0). So, classical momentum is not conserved in this new frame.
Therefore, either (a) conservation of momentum isn't a valid law of
physics; (b) the Relativity Principle (invariance of the laws of
physics) is violated; or (c) we need a new definition for momentum.
</p>
</statement>
</example>

<p>
You probably won't be surprised to hear that Einstein wasn't about to
give up on the Relativity Principle because of this argument. After
all, he had already redefined time and space to make the Principle
work. And although the classical expression for momentum does not lead to
invariance for high velocity collisions, there are attributes of
particles involving their masses and velocities that do produce
invariant conservation laws. These quantities are called relativistic
momentum and relativistic energy, or more simply, momentum and energy.
They are defined by
</p>

<p>
\boxiteq{
<men xml:id="eq_rel-p-def" >
  \vec{p} = \frac{m\vec{u}}{\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}} 
        \text{\hspace{0.2in}\textbf{Definition of relativistic momentum}} ,
</men>
and
</p>

<p>
\boxiteq{
<men xml:id="eq_rel-e-def" >
  E = \frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}} 
\text{\hspace{0.2in}\textbf{Definition of relativistic energy}} .
</men>
</p>

<p>
Einstein was motivated to define momentum and energy in this way
because conservation of momentum and energy defined in this
new way are invariant, as we will show with an example below. Of
course, motivation is all very nice, but the most compelling reason
that the momentum and energy of a particle must be defined this way
instead of in the classical way is because experiments with high-speed
particles it is these new relativistic quantities that are conserved,
and not those given by the classical definitions.
</p>

<p>
Let's explore this invariance by redoing <xref ref="ex_momentum-goodbye">Example</xref>
using Einstein's new definitions and the relativistic conservation laws:
<men>
  \vec{p}_{ before} = \vec{p}_{ after}
</men>
<men xml:id="eq_econs" >
  E_{ before} = E_{ after}
</men>
</p>

<example xml:id="ex_pe-cons">
<statement>
<p>
<xref ref="fig_junk">Figure</xref> shows a particle of mass <m>9\units{MeV/</m>c^2<m>}</m> and

producing a single particle of mass <m>16\units{MeV/</m>c^2<m>}</m>.
You might not be too happy here with the final particle having a mass
of <m>16\units{MeV/</m>c^2<m>}</m>, but hold on a little longer <mdash /> we'll
explain this shortly. (A little preview <mdash /> this might be a good time
to take a pen and scribble Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_mcons" /> out of existence.) In
the next chapter, we'll learn more rigorously how to determine the
correct attributes of the final particle. Here we just want to check
the conservation laws. (a) Check the conservation of relativistic
momentum and relativistic energy in the rest frame of the
<m>5\units{MeV/</m>c^2<m>}</m> particle. (b) Check the conservation of
relativistic momentum and relativistic energy in the rest frame of the
<m>16\units{MeV/</m>c^2<m>}</m> particle.

<em>Solution: </em>
(a) We will use the relativistic definitions and conservation laws given
in Eqs.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_rel-p-def" /><ndash /><xref ref="eq_econs" />. Conservation of momentum
gives
<men>
  \frac{9\units{MeV/$c^2$}\times 0.8c}{\sqrt{1 - 0.8^2}} + 0 = 
\frac{16\units{MeV/$c^2$}\times 0.6c}{\sqrt{1 - 0.6^2}},
</men>
and conservation of energy gives
<men>
  \frac{9\units{MeV/$c^2$}\times c^2}{\sqrt{1 - 0.8^2}} 
 + \frac{5\units{MeV/$c^2$}\times c^2}{\sqrt{1 - 0^2}}= 
\frac{16\units{MeV/$c^2$}\times c^2}{\sqrt{1 - 0.6^2}}.
</men>
</p>

<p>
The momentum equation gives <m>12\units{MeV/</m>c<m>} = 12\units{MeV/</m>c<m>}</m>,
while the energy equation gives <m>15\units{MeV} + 5\units{MeV} = 20\units{MeV}</m>.
So the conservation laws are satisfied in this frame.
</p>

<p>
(b) Now, transform to a frame in which the final particle is at rest, by
viewing from a spaceship moving at <m>0.6c</m> to the right. The velocity
transformations give
<md>
  <mrow>  u_{16}^\prime \amp =\amp  \frac{u_{16}-v}{1 - u_{16}v/c^2} 
   = \frac{0.6c -0.6 c}{1-0.6^2} = 0</mrow>
  <mrow>  u_{5}^\prime \amp =\amp  \frac{u_{5}-v}{1 - u_{5}v/c^2} 
   = \frac{0 -0.6 c}{1-0\times 0.6} = -0.6c = -\frac{3}{5}c</mrow>
  <mrow>  u_{9}^\prime \amp =\amp  \frac{u_{9}-v}{1 - u_{9}v/c^2} 
   = \frac{0.8c -0.6 c}{1-0.8\times 0.6} = \frac{5}{13}c \simeq 0.385c</mrow>
</md>
</p>
<figure xml:id="fig_junk2" >
<caption>Collision discussed in <xref ref="ex_pe-cons">Example</xref> as viewed from

of product particle.</caption>
<image width="71%" source="images/relpande4.png" />
</figure>
<p>
In this new frame, the collision appears as in Fig. <xref ref="fig_junk2"></xref>.
When we check the relativistic conservation laws in this new frame, we find:
<men>
  \frac{9\units{MeV/$c^2$}\times 5c/13}{\sqrt{1 - (5/13)^2}} 
    -  \frac{5\units{MeV/$c^2$}\times 3c/5}{\sqrt{1 - (3/5)^2}}= 
\frac{16\units{MeV/$c^2$}\times 0}{\sqrt{1 - 0^2}}
</men>
<men>
  \frac{9\units{MeV/$c^2$}\times c^2}{\sqrt{1 - (5/13)^2}} 
 + \frac{5\units{MeV/$c^2$}\times c^2}{\sqrt{1 - (3/5)^2}}= 
\frac{16\units{MeV/$c^2$}\times c^2}{\sqrt{1 - 0^2}}
</men>
</p>

<p>
The momentum equation gives
<men>
  \frac{15}{4}\units{MeV/$c$} -\frac{15}{4}\units{MeV/$c$} = 0,
</men>
which checks out, while the energy equation gives
<men>
  \frac{39}{4}\units{MeV} +\frac{25}{4}\units{MeV} = 16\units{MeV}
</men>
which also checks out. This means the conservation laws are true in
both the original and the new frame, and the Relativity Principle is
upheld with Einstein's new definitions.
</p>
</statement>
</example>

<p>
This may be a nice argument on paper, but does it work in practice?
Are relativistic momentum and energy, rather than classical momentum
and mass, really conserved in particle interactions? The answer is an
emphatic <em>YES</em>! In countless interactions observed in high-energy
particle accelerators, relativistic momentum and energy are always
found to be conserved.

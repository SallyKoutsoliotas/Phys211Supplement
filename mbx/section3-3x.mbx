Duck Dodgers hops in his spaceship and leaves the Earth at a
speed <m>0.6c</m> in an attempt to reach the newly discovered Planet X before
aliens from Mars.
<ol>
<li><p>Mission control on Earth sends an encoded message (a
    flashing beacon) to Duck Dodgers warning him about the progress of
    the Martian ship.  The light pulses travel at a speed <m>c</m> relative
    to observers on the Earth.  How fast are the pulses traveling
    relative to Duck Dodgers?</p></li>
<li><p>Duck Dodgers doesn't understand the message that he
    received, so he sends a radio message back toward the Earth asking
    for clarification.  The radio signal is traveling at a speed <m>c</m>
    relative to the Duck.  How fast is the signal traveling relative
    to observers on the Earth?</p></li>
<li><p>The radio message is intercepted by the Martian who is
    behind Duck Dodgers but traveling in the same direction at a speed
    <m>0.8c</m> relative to the Earth.  How fast is the radio message going
    relative to the Martian?</p></li>
<li><p>The radio message is also intercepted by one of the
    Martian's monsters who is traveling back toward the Earth to
    attack.  The monster is traveling at a speed <m>0.9c</m> relative to the
    Martian.  How fast is the radio signal relative to the monster?</p></li>

<title>Another Invariant</title>
<p>
We now have relativistic expressions for energy and momentum.
It turns out that these can be combined to form an invariant, just
like we combined distance and time to get the invariant spacetime
interval. Recall from chapter 4, we defined the square of the
interval as
<men>
  I^2 = \left(c\Delta t\right)^2 - \left(\Delta x\right)^2.
</men>
</p>

<p>
We can combine energy and momentum of an object or particle in a
similar manner to get an invariant:
<men xml:id="eq_m-invariance1" >
  m^2 = \left(\frac{E}{c^2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{p}{c}\right)^2.
</men>
</p>

<p>
Given any object or particle with energy <m>E</m> and momentum <m>p</m> as
measured by an observer in a reference frame, this observer can easily
calculate the value of <m>m</m> for that object. If a different observer is
in another reference frame (labeled with <q>primes</q>) and determines
<m>E^\prime</m> and <m>p^\prime</m> for the same particle, she will find that
if she calculates
<men>
  \left(m^\prime\right)^2 = \left(\frac{E^\prime}{c^2}\right)^2 
          - \left(\frac{p^\prime}{c}\right)^2,
</men>
then she will get exactly the same value for <m>m^\prime</m> that the first
observer found for <m>m</m>. In other words
<men>
  m=m^\prime,
</men>
or
<men xml:id="eq_m-invariance2" >
  E^2 - (pc)^2 = \left(E^\prime\right)^2 - \left(p^\prime c\right)^2.
</men>
</p>

<p>
In the same manner that we used the invariant spacetime interval to
relate <m>\Delta x</m> and <m>\Delta t</m> as measured in one reference frame to
<m>\Delta x^\prime</m> and <m>\Delta t^\prime</m> in
another reference frame, we can use the invariance of <m>m</m> to relate <m>E</m>
and <m>p</m> in one frame to <m>E^\prime</m> and <m>p^\prime</m> in a different frame.
</p>

<p>
What is this invariant <m>m</m>? This is simply the mass of the object.
In words, the invariance expressed in
Eqs.<nbsp />( <xref ref="eq_m-invariance1"></xref><ndash /> <xref ref="eq_m-invariance2"></xref>) states that
all observers agree about the mass of an object.<fn>You may hear
people saying that in relativity, <q>a person's mass increases as (s)he
approaches the speed of light.</q>  (In fact, it used to be common for
physicists to say this.)  This is an unfortunate claim.  What they are
doing is saying, <q>Well, since <m>p = mu/\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}</m>, we're going
to artificially call <m>m/\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}</m> the relativistic mass so
that we can hold on to the <m>p=mu</m> definition of momentum.</q>  There is
no reason to do this <mdash /> there is nothing in relativity that requires
us to redefine mass and, in fact, mass is an invariant.</fn>
</p>

<p>
We can rewrite Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_m-invariance1" /> in a slightly more
convenient form
<men xml:id="eq_m-invariance3" >
  E^2 - (pc)^2 = (mc^2)^2.
</men>
</p>

<p>
As we'll see in the next chapter, this is actually the most useful of
all the energy and momentum relations. It applies to <em>every</em>
particle in <em>every</em> situation. (We'll see that
Eqs.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_rel-p-def" /> and <xref ref="eq_rel-e-def" /> aren't very useful
for `particles' of light.) In the homework for tonight, you'll show
that this relation comes very easily from the relativistic definitions
for energy and momentum <xref ref="eq_rel-p-def" /> and <xref ref="eq_rel-e-def" />.

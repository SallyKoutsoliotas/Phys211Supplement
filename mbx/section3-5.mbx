<title>Rest Energy and Kinetic Energy</title>
<p>
Let's look more closely at what we called the relativistic energy of a
particle in Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_rel-e-def" />. If the particle is at rest, so
that <m>u = 0</m>, the energy reduces to <m>E = mc^2</m>, perhaps the most famous
formula in all of physics. So we discover that a particle has energy
even when it's not moving! This energy is called the <em>rest energy</em>,
<m>E_0</m>. That is
<men xml:id="eq_emc2" >
  E_0 = mc^2.
</men>
</p>

<p>
This is a remarkable result! Consider an apple with a mass of
<m>100\units{g}=0.1\units{kg}</m>. Einstein
says that this apple has an energy at rest of <m>E_0 = 
0.1\units{kg}\times (3\times 10^8)^2 = 9\times 10^{15}\units{J}</m>!
This is a huge amount of energy. Let's compare this to a classical
energy.
</p>

<p>
You know that the classical kinetic energy of a particle is
<m>K_{ class.}  = \frac{1}{2}mv^2</m>. For the <m>0.1\units{kg}</m>
apple falling at <m>10\units{m/s}</m> we get <m>K_{ class.} = 5\units{J}</m>.
This is the energy that the apple has because it is in motion.
In relativistic physics, kinetic energy is not expressed as
<m>K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2</m>, but it is still defined as the energy that
a particle has <em>because it is in motion</em>. The relativistic
kinetic energy is the difference between a particle's energy when
it is moving and its rest energy,
<men xml:id="eq_rel-k-def" >
  K = E - mc^2 = \frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}} - mc^2.
</men>
</p>

<p>
This doesn't resemble the classical expression for kinetic
energy <m>K_{ class.} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2</m> (or, since we
use <m>v</m> for the velocity of the frame and <m>u</m> as the velocity of the
particle, <m>K = \frac{1}{2}mu^2</m>). Since we know that the classical
expression for kinetic energy is valid in the low-speed regime, the
relativistic kinetic energy given be Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_rel-k-def" /> must
somehow reduce to the classical expression when the speed of the
particle is small compared to the speed of light. We show the
connection between the relativistic and classical forms of kinetic
energy in the next example.
</p>

<p>
The relativistic expressions for energy and kinetic energy have
amazing consequences. In collisions of high speed particles, or
in radioactive decays, it is the total energy of a system of
particles that is conserved, not the mass. In these processes,
rest energy (<m>mc^2</m>) can be converted into kinetic energy, and vice
versa. In a decay, the loss of a small amount of mass corresponds to the
loss of a huge amount of rest energy, which will be manifested
in a huge increase in kinetic energy.

for kinetic energy}

<p>
Use the binomial approximation in Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_rel-k-def" /> to find
an approximate expression for <m>K</m> when <m>u</m> is much smaller than
<m>c</m>, i.e., when <m>u/c \ll 1</m>. (The binomial expansion states that
<m>(1-\epsilon)^{-1/2} \simeq 1 + \frac{1}{2}\epsilon + \cdots</m> if
<m>\epsilon</m> is small.)
</p>

<p>
<em>Solution: </em>
We write <m>1/\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}</m> as <m>(1 - u^2/c^2)^{-1/2}</m> so that
Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_rel-k-def" /> becomes
<md>
  <mrow>  K \amp =\amp  mc^2\left(1-u^2/c^2\right)^{-1/2} - mc^2 \nonumber</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp =\amp  mc^2 \left(1 + \frac{1}{2}\frac{u^2}{c^2} + \cdots\right) - mc^2</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp \simeq\amp   \frac{1}{2}mu^2 \nonumber,</mrow>
</md>
where in the last line we have assumed the classical limit in which
<m>u/c \ll 1</m>.
Thus we see that the classical expression for kinetic energy is only a
low-velocity approximation to the correct expression, given by
Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_rel-k-def" />.

<title>Photons: Particles with Zero Mass</title>
<p>
How do we deal with the energy and momentum of light? As you will see
next semester in PHYS 212, the same year that Einstein published his
first paper on Special Relativity, he also proposed that light must be
considered to be composed of particles which are now called photons.
(This was the first of the three 1905 papers that we discussed at the
beginning of <xref ref="chapter_relativityI">Chapter</xref>.) Since light always travels
at a speed <m>c</m> in a vacuum, then photons in a vacuum must travel at
that speed regardless of the reference frame of the observer. But if
we look back at Eqs.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_rel-p-def" /> and <xref ref="eq_rel-e-def" />, we
find that the denominators of both equations are zero for a particle
moving at the speed of light, and clearly a photon cannot have
infinite momentum or infinite energy.
</p>

<p>
The only way to resolve this dilemma is to postulate that photons are
particles with zero mass (<m>m = 0</m>). Equations<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_rel-p-def" />
and <xref ref="eq_rel-e-def" /> are still not very useful in this case, since a
fraction which has zero in both the numerator and denominator is
undefined. However, with zero mass these equations no longer imply
infinite energy and momentum for particles moving at light speed.
</p>

<p>
For a massless particle (such as photons),
Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_m-invariance3" /> can be rewritten for <m>m=0</m> as
<men xml:id="eq_e-photon" >
  E = \vert p\vert c\text{\hspace{0.25in}\textbf{for massless particles only.}}
</men>
</p>

<p>
Remember, Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_e-photon" /> is valid only for massless
particles.

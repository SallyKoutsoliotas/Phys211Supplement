<title>More experimental evidence</title>
<p>
Now that we have introduced the relativistic relations for energy and
momentum, we can discuss some additional pieces of evidence that
Einstein's theory of relativity is, in fact, correct. The following
examples can be added to those presented in <xref ref="chapter_relativityI">Chapter</xref>. Remember that if even one of these
experiments had disagreed with Einstein's theory, then the entire
theory would have to be thrown out since everything is internally
consistent.
<ul>
<li><p><em>Particle accelerators</em>. As we already discussed in
<xref ref="chapter_relativityI">Chapter</xref>, subatomic particles are frequently
accelerated in high energy experiments to speeds very close to <m>c</m>,
but no one has ever managed to accelerate a particle with mass to a
speed greater than <m>c</m>.  There's more here, though: as the particle's
speed (relative to the laboratory) gets closer and closer to <m>c</m>, the
amount of energy that has to be added to increase the speed further
gets larger and larger, diverging as the speed approach <m>c</m>.  For
instance, the amount of energy that needs to be added to accelerate a
particle from <m>0.98c</m> to <m>0.99c</m> has been found experimentally to be much
larger than the energy to accelerate the same particle from <m>0.97c</m> to
<m>0.98c</m>, and in fact, much larger than that predicted classically.  As
is the case with all other tests of relativity, the amount of energy
to be added agrees perfectly with Einstein's predictions.  Homework
<xref ref="prob_energy-to-accelerate">problem</xref>  investigates this further.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Collisions of high-energy particles</em>.  When subatomic
particles are slammed into each other with high energies, new
particles are actually created that weren't there before the
collision.  These collisions are converting kinetic energy (KE) into
matter, and this is done all the time in particle accelerators.  (This
is, in fact, the main tool that physicists use to study massive
subatomic particles.)  This is an experimental result that simply
cannot be explained classically.  Once again, though, the results
agree perfectly with Einstein's theory.  We will be discussing this in
more detail in <xref ref="chapter_relativity_app">Chapter</xref>, and you will be doing
(or have already done) a lab on this (the Relativistic Energy and
Momentum lab).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Matter-to-KE conversions</em>.  One of the most convincing and
most dramatic tests of Einstein's theory of relativity occurred on
July 16, 1945, in New Mexico when the first atomic bomb was exploded,
converting matter into a horrifying amount of kinetic energy (don't
forget that factor of <m>c^2</m> in the famous <m>E = mc^2</m> equation).  Since
then, there have been quite a few additional such demonstrations of
Einstein's theory.  (And again, the quantitative aspects of these
demonstrations agree perfectly with the theory.)
    
It isn't necessary to explode a bomb to convert matter into energy.
Nuclear energy has found peaceful applications in the area of power
generation. (There is a nuclear power plant in Berwick, PA, in fact,
which you can see easily if you drive on Rt.<nbsp />80 toward New Jersey,
shortly after passing Bloomsburg).  We will discuss nuclear power
generation more in the next chapter (including fusion power <mdash />  still
being developed <mdash /> which doesn't produce any long-lasting radioactive
waste).</p></li>

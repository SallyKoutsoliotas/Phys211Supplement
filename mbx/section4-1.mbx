<title>Introduction</title>

In our everyday lives we experience many examples where mechanical
energy is not conserved: brakes slow down a car, a bouncing superball
returns to a lower height than it started from, and blow darts slide
to a stop along the corridors of Bucknell residence halls. Because
friction takes mechanical energy away from an object, historically
it was not at all obvious that energy should be conserved.
But some physicists in the 19th century noticed that when friction
acts to slow an object and take away some mechanical energy, the
object invariably becomes hotter. This suggested that temperature is
connected to some kind of internal energy of the object <mdash /> let's call
it <em>thermal energy</em> <mdash /> and that friction has acted to convert
some of the object's mechanical energy to this thermal energy.
Careful experiments by Joule and others confirmed the hypothesis that
total energy is conserved even when mechanical energy is gained or
lost, and now energy conservation is one of the most fundamental
principles in physics.

But what is thermal energy? As we shall see, it is nothing more than
the kinetic and potential energy of the individual molecules that make
up the objects in our everyday world. In this unit we will begin by
distinguishing mechanical energy from thermal energy.

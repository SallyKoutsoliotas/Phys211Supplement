<problem xml:id="problem_flattium">
<statement>
<p>
To understand better how the ideal solid thermal energy
is derived, consider the following scenario.
A mad scientist creates a new material, flattium, in which the
molecules can only move in the <m>x</m>-<m>y</m> plane, while their <m>z</m>
coordinates remain fixed. Consider how
Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_ball-spring_energy" /> would be changed, and then use
the equipartition theorem to derive an expression for the thermal energy of
flattium.

Specific heats are often given by the amount of thermal energy
required to raise the temperature of <em>one kilogram</em> of material by
a degree, rather than <em>one mole</em> of material. The per-kilogram
specific heat <m>c</m> satisfies <m>\Delta E_\text{ therm }  = m_\text{ obj }  c

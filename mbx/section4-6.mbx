<title>Temperature</title>
<p>
We began the chapter mentioning that when mechanical energy gets
converted to thermal energy, the temperature increases. But what is
temperature? Everyone has an intuitive feel for it: we know that a
high temperature corresponds to something that is <q>hot</q> and a low
temperature corresponds to something that is <q>cold.</q> We also know
from experience that <q>heat</q> <mdash /> which we will define shortly <mdash /> flows
from hot (high temperature) to cold (low temperature) objects.
</p>

<p>
It is common in many introductory text books to define temperature as
a measure of the average thermal kinetic energy <m>K_\text{ therm } /N</m> of
a material.<fn>Historically, this approach was used successfully
  in the <m>18^\text{ th }</m> and <m>19^\text{ th }</m> centuries to develop the
  first successful quantitative theories of thermodynamics, referred
  to as the <em>kinetic theory</em> of thermodynamics.</fn> This definition of
temperature is not valid for all situations (we will provide a more
rigorous definition of temperature in <xref ref="chapter_second_law">Chapter</xref>); however, there are many situations that can
benefit from simple view of temperature as a measure of thermal
kinetic energy.

<p>
We must talk about temperature units. The Celsius
temperature scale is defined so that water freezes at a temperature of
<m>0^\circ\units{C}</m> and water boils at <m>100^\circ\units{C}</m>. Considering
temperature as a measure of kinetic energy, we can define <em>absolute
zero</em> as the temperature where all molecular motion stops. This occurs at
<m>-273.15^\circ\units{C}</m> in the Celsius scale.

  temperature scales.  They differ by a shift:  <m>T_K=T_C+273</m></caption>

<p>
A important variation on the Celsius temperature scale is called the
Kelvin scale, illustrated in Fig. <xref ref="fig_temperature_scales"></xref>. The
<q>size</q> of the degree is the same for Kelvin and Celsius, that is, a
change in temperature of <m>1\units{K}</m> is the same as a change in
temperature of <m>1^\circ\units{C}</m>. The boiling temperature of water
is still <m>100\units{K}</m> higher than the freezing temperature. The
difference in the scales is the location of zero: in the Kelvin scale,
absolute zero corresponds to <m>0\units{K}</m>, water freezes at
<m>273\units{K}</m> and boils at <m>373\units{K}</m>. The Kelvin temperature
scale is the one best suited for most thermodynamics problems.

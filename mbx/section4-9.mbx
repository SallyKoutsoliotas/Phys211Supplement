<title>Ideal Solid Specific Heat</title>
<p>
To determine the molar specific heat of an ideal solid,
let us make the approximation that the neighbors of
a particular molecule remain fixed. This turns out to be a reasonable
approximation for most solids. Then the energy describing that
particular molecule is
<men xml:id="eq_ball-spring_energy" >
  E_\text{ molecule }  = {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}mv_x^2 +
{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}mv_y^2 + {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}mv_z^2 +
{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}k_\text{ sp } x^2 + {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}k_{ sp}y^2 +
{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}k_\text{ sp } z^2.
</men>
</p>

<p>
There are six terms contributing to the energy, all of which are
quadratic. Each term is fluctuating up and down as the molecule
interacts with its neighbors. The equipartition theorem tell us,
then, that the average energy of this ball over time will be
<men>
  \langle E_\text{ molecule } \rangle =
6\left({\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}k_BT\right) = 3k_BT.
</men>
</p>

<p>
Now consider an <m>N</m> molecule ideal solid. The number of moles
is given by <m>n = N/N_A</m>, and the
thermal energy will be
<men xml:id="eq_E_thermal" >
  E_\text{ therm }  = N (3 k_B T) = \frac{N}{N_A}(3k_BN_A)T = n3RT,
\text{ (ideal solid) }
</men>
where <m>R=N_A k_B = 8.31\units{J/mol</m>\cdot<m>K}</m> is called the gas
constant, although it has nothing in particular to do with
gases.<fn>This isn't our fault either.</fn>
</p>

<p>
Comparing Eqs.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_E_thermal" /> and <xref ref="eq_Ethermspecificheat" />,
the molar specific heat of the ideal solid is
<men>
  C = 3R = 24.9\units{J/mol$\cdot$K} \qquad\text{ (ideal solid) }
</men>
regardless of the material. This relation is known as the
Dulong-Petit law. The molar specific heats of most solids agree with
the Dulong-Petit result to within a few percent accuracy. For
example, the molar specific heat of copper is <m>C_\text{ Cu }  =
24.4\units{J/mol</m>\cdot<m>K}</m>, and comparable values for a variety of
other solids are given in <xref ref="table_material_properties">Table</xref>. This
provides more evidence that the ball-spring model of the ideal solid
is reasonable.

Finally, note that the specific heat is only defined in terms of
<m>\Delta E_\text{ therm }</m> and <m>\Delta T</m>; it relates <em>changes</em> in
the temperature to changes in thermal energy. However, if we assume
that the specific heat is independent of temperature, which is a
reasonable approximation down to some low temperature, then we can
also estimate
<men>
  E_\text{ therm }  \approx nCT = n3RT. \qquad\text{ (ideal solid) }

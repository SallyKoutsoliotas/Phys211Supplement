<title>Phases of Matter</title>
<p>
Since the dawn of human existence, people have noticed that
matter could be solid, liquid, or gas. What cavewoman Thag and her
contemporaries did not realize is that these quite different phases
are made up of the same stuff: molecules that are
pushing and pulling on each other, sometimes in a solid phase, sometimes
a liquid and sometimes a gas.
She was not the only one who didn't understand this. Plato didn't
know about molecules. Nor did Dante, or even Newton. Only after the
seminal work of Boltzmann and Einstein around the turn of the 20<m>^{ th}</m>
century did our process of scientific discovery lead us to understand the
molecular form of matter.
</p>

<p>
This discovery is one of the crowning achievements of our species, and
is also very practical, having provided the basis for most of our
modern technology. The great 20th century physicist Richard
Feynman<fn>You're going to be hearing more about him in PHYS
  212.</fn> once remarked
</p>
<blockquote>
<q>If, in some cataclysm, all scientific knowledge were to be
  destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generation of
  creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the
  fewest words? I believe it is the atomic hypothesis <ellipsis /> that all
  things are made of atoms <mdash /> little particles that move around in
  perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little
  distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one
  another. In that one sentence you will see an enormous amount of
  information about the world, if just a little imagination and
  thinking are applied.</q>
</blockquote>
<p>
Let us now follow Feynman's suggestion and apply a little
imagination and thinking.
</p>

<p>
We have been discussing the solid phase of matter, where the particles
are arranged in a regular lattice pattern, and the forces between the
particles can be well-modeled as springs attached between neighbors.
But we know from everyday experience that a solid can be melted when
heated enough. Consider a lattice of vibrating molecules. Once the
molecular excursions become large enough, the molecules start slipping
past one another. As a result, the regular arrangement of the
molecules in the lattice breaks down and the molecules are now
disordered. They are still very closely packed and the density is
comparable to the solid state, but the object has no rigidity. This
is a liquid.

<p>
For most substances, there exists a boiling point separating a liquid
phase from a gas phase. The picture you should have for the gas state
is molecules moving about freely, far from their neighbors, and moving
in a straight line until they collide with another molecule or with
the walls of the container. Like a liquid, the gas phase is
disordered. But the density of gases is much lower than liquids.
Another difference between liquids and gases that we can understand
immediately from the molecular viewpoint is their compressibility.
Because the gas is dilute, we can compress a gas if we push the walls
of the container inward. The molecules end up a bit closer together
and bounce around a little faster, but otherwise they don't object.
Liquids are essentially incompressible: you can't squeeze water to fit
into a smaller volume. The liquid molecules are already packed
together, albeit in a messy way, and any further squeezing is resisted
by the repulsive forces of the pair potential.

<p>
Our basic understanding of the thermal energy of matter, developed
in <xref ref="section_thermal_kinetic_energy">sections</xref> and <xref ref="section_thermal_potential_energy"></xref> for solids
applies for liquids and gases as well: in particular,
thermal kinetic energy is associated with motion of the molecules.
And the potential energy associated with
the forces between the molecules <mdash /> i.e., the pair potential <mdash />
provides the thermal potential energy.
However, there are significant differences in the thermal
potential energy for the different phases:
<ul>
<li><p>in the solid phase are the molecules very near their equilibrium
  separation, allowing us to approximate their forces with springs</p></li>
<li><p>in the liquid phase, however, the potential energy is
  complicated, since the molecules are pushed closer together and
  pulled farther apart as the molecules squeeze by each other, making
  the spring approximation invalid, and</p></li>
<li><p>in the gas phase, the molecules are so far apart that, except for
  very brief collisions, there is no potential energy.</p></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In contrast to these differences, the thermal <em>kinetic energy</em>
is identical in form in all three phases. This allows us to develop the
notion of thermal speed.

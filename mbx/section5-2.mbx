<title>Thermal Speed</title>
<p>
For all phases of matter, the translational kinetic
energy of a single molecule is
<men xml:id="eq_k_molecule" >
  K_\text{ trans }  = {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}} m v_x^2 + 
{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}} m v_y^2 + {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}} m v_z^2.
</men>
</p>

<p>
We can take advantage of this to determine how fast the molecules are
moving at some given temperature <m>T</m>.
Via the equipartition theorem, we can say that the average
translational kinetic energy is
<men>
  \langle K_\text{ trans } \bigr\rangle = \textstyle
  \bigl\langle\frac{1}{2}mv_x^2\bigr\rangle 
  +\bigl\langle\frac{1}{2}mv_y^2\bigr\rangle 
  +\bigl\langle\frac{1}{2}mv_z^2\bigr\rangle 
= \frac{3}{2}k_BT,   \text{ (single molecule) }
</men>
since there are three quadratic terms in the energy. Recalling that
<m>v^2=v_x^2+v_y^2+v_z^2</m>, we can write
<men>
  \frac{3}{2}k_BT = \textstyle\bigl\langle \frac{1}{2}mv^2\bigr\rangle = 
  \frac{1}{2}m\langle v^2\rangle \Rightarrow
  \langle v^2\rangle = 3 k_B T/m.
</men>
</p>

<p>
Now we define the thermal speed, which indicates the typical speed of
the molecules, as<fn>Why didn't we simply define
  <m>v_\text{ therm }</m> as the average velocity <m>\langle \vec v\rangle</m>?
  Because the average velocity is zero, which tells us nothing about
  the typical magnitude of the velocity.</fn>
<men xml:id="eq_v_thermal" >
  v_\text{ therm }  =  \sqrt{\langle v^2\rangle}= \sqrt{\frac{3k_BT}{m}} = 
  \sqrt{\frac{3RT}{M}}
</men>
where <m>m</m> is the molecular mass and <m>M</m> is the molar
mass.<fn>A.k.a. what is often horribly called the <q>molecular
  weight</q> (horrible because its a mass, not a weight, and it's for a
  mole of molecules, not just one).  From here on, we'll abandon that
  nonsensical term and call it molar mass.</fn> The second equality above
comes from multiplying numerator and denominator by <m>N_A</m> and then
using <m>M = N_A m</m> and <m>R=N_Ak_B</m>. So we have shown, via
equipartition, a direct connection between the temperature and the
translational kinetic energy.

{Speed of Nitrogen in the Atmosphere}
What is the typical speed of a nitrogen molecule in the atmosphere at
room temperature of <m>22^\circ\units{C}</m>?


<em>Solution: </em>
First we need to convert the temperature to Kelvin:
<m>T = 273 + 22 = 295\units{K}</m>.
The molar mass of elemental nitrogen is <m>14\units{g/mol}</m>. However,
nitrogen in the air is in molecular form, <m>N_2</m>, which has two nitrogen
atoms per molecule, and a molar mass of <m>28\units{g/mol}</m>. We
may use Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_v_thermal" />, but to be consistent with SI units,
we should convert the molar mass to kilograms:
<md>
  <mrow>  v_\text{ therm }  \amp = \sqrt{\frac{3 R T}{M}} = \sqrt{
 \frac{3(8.31\units{J/mol$\cdot$K})(295\units{K})}{0.028\units{kg/mol}}}
\nonumber</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp = 512\units{m/s}</mrow>
</md>
which is the same as about 1150 m.p.h. Room temperature molecules are fast!
</p>
</statement>
</example>

<p>
A variation of this approach (i.e., using the equipartition theorem)
can be used to determine
how much a typical molecule is displaced from its
equilibrium position but in the <em>solid phase only!</em> This is discussed
(along with an example) in Sec. <xref ref="sec_phase_transitions"></xref>.

<title>The Liquid State</title>
<p>
In the liquid state, the pair potential <q>springs</q> are continually
pushing and pulling and then getting stretched to the distance where
they weaken and let go. In this way, molecules freely change their
neighbors and slide past one another, which is why a liquid can flow.
In this complicated picture, it is not possible to make a simple
calculation for the thermal potential energy. The molar specific heat
depends in a complicated way on the details of the pair potential, and
so it varies considerably from material to material. While physicists
and chemists have developed advanced theories for describing the
liquid state, these are beyond the scope of this course.

<p>
However, if we are given a measured specific heat, such as that of
water, we can still relate changes in the thermal energy to
temperature changes via
<men>
  \Delta E_\text{ therm }  = n C_\text{ liq } \Delta T
</men>
</p>

<p>
Measured values of the specific heat are given for a few different liquids
in <xref ref="table_liquid_specific_heats">Table</xref>.

<p>
Note that <m>C_\text{ liq }</m> is different than the specific heat of the
solid state for the same material. It is typically larger.
For example, for copper molar specific heat in the liquid phase
is <m>C_\text{ liq }  = 36.3\units{J/mol</m>\cdot<m>K}</m>, compared
to <m>C_\text{s} =24.4\units{J/mol</m>\cdot<m>K}</m> in the solid phase.

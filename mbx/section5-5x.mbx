<em>Melting iron</em>
<ol>
<li><p>Use your results from
    <xref ref="chapter_thermal_energy">Problem</xref>. <xref ref="problem_ball-spring_iron"></xref>
    to estimate the typical thermal displacement for atoms in a chunk
    of solid iron at room temperature.  (Assume a room temperature of
    <m>22^{\circ}\units{C}</m>.)  Compare your result to the typical
    lattice separation for the iron atoms.  Based on this result and
    the Lindemann criterion, explain why it is reasonable that iron is
    a solid at room temperature.</p></li>
<li><p>Now, assuming that iron melts when the typical displacement is
    one-tenth the lattice separation (i.e., <m>x_\text{ therm }  \approx
    d/10</m>, which is the Lindemann criterion), estimate the melting
    temperature of iron.  Compare your result to the experimental
    value.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a sentence explaining in your own words why the melting
    temperature should be related to the typical thermal displacement
    <m>x_\text{ therm }</m>.  Don't worry so much about the factor <m>1/10</m> in
    the Lindemann melting criterion, but your explanation <em>should</em>
    state why melting occurs when <m>x_\text{ therm }</m> gets sufficiently large.</p></li>

<em>Let's play microwave.</em> This is just fun, and
you've got to do it. Load up the molecular dynamics applet, select
the solid preset, and click <q>Start</q>. Now we're going to melt the
solid without adding heat. This is exactly what a microwave oven
does: the microwaves do work, pushing and pulling molecules around,
and this gets converted to thermal energy. So let's do the same
thing. You can <q>pull</q> a molecule by clicking on it and dragging
it. Reach in and pull on a molecule, and then wait and watch how the
system responds. Now do it again. Keep doing it until you've fully
melted the solid. (Notes: it might help to reduce the <q>Animation
speed</q> so that you can see what is going on. You also might have
to pull your mouse a large distance quickly before letting go when
<q>pulling</q> a molecule.)
<ol>
<li><p>Describe what you observe in the simulation and what you had to
  do to melt the solid by pulling on individual atoms.  <em>    Question:</em> Why would pulling on just one or two individual atoms
  melt the entire solid?</p></li>
<li><p>Now think of something else cool to do with the applet.  Write a
  few sentences describing what you did and what you found.</p></li>

<problem xml:id="problem_ideal_gas_quant">
<statement>
<p>
In this problem you will make some simplifying assumptions and estimate
the pressure of a gas of nitrogen molecules from a microscopic picture
of the gas. Assume that the gas is in a <m>10\units{cm} \times 
  10\units{cm}\times 10\units{cm}</m> box at room temperature,
<m>T = 22^\circ\units{C}</m>. The assumptions are:
<ul>
<li><p>All the molecules travel at the speed <m>v_\text{ therm }</m> derived 
  in <xref ref="example_vtherm">Example</xref>.  This is 
  not actually true <mdash /> there is a spread in 
  molecular speeds around the average <mdash />
  but <m>v_\text{ therm }</m> is a typical speed.</p></li>
<li><p>One third of the molecules in the gas travel in the <m>\pm x</m>-direction,
  one third travel in the <m>\pm y</m>-direction, and one third travel in the 
  <m>\pm z</m>-direction.  This is obviously not true, but this assumption will
  simplify the calculations.</p></li>

<li><p>Calculate the numerical value of the <em>change</em> in the momentum of 
  a single nitrogen molecule traveling in the <m>x</m>-direction after it 
  collides elastically with the right wall of the container.  (If you 
  need help determining the speed of the nitrogen molecules, see <xref ref="example_vtherm">Example</xref>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate the number of times this single nitrogen molecule 
  collides with the right wall of the container in 1 second.</p></li>

  (i.e., the number of molecules per unit volume) of 
  nitrogen molecules is <m>2.49\times 10^{19}\units{molecules/cm</m>^{3}<m>}</m>.  
  Use the second of our simplifying assumptions and calculate the 
  average force on the right wall of the container due to all of the 
  molecules in the gas.</p></li>

<title>Pressure</title>
<p>
Liquids and gases push outwardly on their surroundings. To describe
this push we introduce the concept of <em>pressure</em>. Consider a
liquid or a gas enclosed in some container, and focus on one wall of
the container with area <m>A</m>, such as shown in
Fig. <xref ref="fig_gas_pressure"></xref>. The fluid pushes on the wall in the
perpendicular direction with a force of magnitude <m>F</m>. Pressure is
then the force per area
<men>
  p=\frac{F}{A},
</men>
and has units N/m<m>^2</m>. This combination of units is given the name
pascal (Pa), that is, <m>1\units{Pa} = 1\units{N/m</m>^2<m>}</m>. Atmospheric
pressure is given by
<men>
  p_\text{ atm }  = 1.01\times 10^{5} \units{Pa} = 101\units{kPa}.
</men>
</p>

<p>
Note that pressure applies to more than just liquids and gases. Any
time that there is a force exerted on a surface, you can define a
pressure simply by dividing that force by the surface area.
Conceptually, the pressure indicates how <q>spread out</q> the force is,
i.e., if the same force is exerted over a larger surface area, then
there is less force per unit area (smaller pressure) and each part of
the surface experiences a smaller force. That is why, for example, it
is useful to wear snowshoes with a large surface area when walking
over fresh snow <mdash /> the downward force you exert on the ground is
spread over a larger area, resulting in a smaller pressure on the
snow, so the snow doesn't collapse.
</p>

<p>
Pressure does not have a direction. If we consider some point in the
fluid, pressure is an outward push in all directions. This outward
push is balanced by an identical outward push from a neighboring
region of the gas. Only at the boundaries of the gas is there an
imbalance <mdash /> here the enclosed gas is only pushing from inside <mdash /> and
that is where we can measure the pressure. And note: <em>a gas
can ONLY push on a surface; it NEVER pulls!!!</em>

We can use our picture of the gas state to derive the pressure of a
gas. In the <em>ideal gas</em> approximation we ignore collisions
between the molecules entirely, and treat each molecule as bouncing
back and forth between the walls of the container. The particles bouncing
off the walls exert a force on the wall, and this is precisely the
origin of pressure.

{Pressure and Balloons}
Explain qualitatively how the gas inside an inflated balloon
prevents the balloon from collapsing.
</p>

<p>
<em>Solution: </em> When a balloon is inflated, the rubber is stretched in all
directions, resulting in an increased tension. At every point along
the surface of the balloon fabric, the tension pulls in all
directions along the surface. Because of the curvature of the
balloon, these tension forces add up to give a net inward tension
force.
</p>

<p>
The inward components of the tension do not cause the balloon to
collapse because there is an outward force due to air molecules
trapped within the balloon bouncing off the inner surface of the
balloon. Each time a molecule bounces off a piece of the balloon,
it gives that piece a small outward kick. Of course, there are also
molecules outside the balloon, and each time one of these bounces
off the balloon, it gives a small inward kick. If the outward and
inward forces were balanced, which is what happens with an open
balloon, then the net force would be the tension force, and the
balloon would rapidly shrink.
</p>

<p>
But what if the collisions from the inside molecules are more
frequent and/or harder collisions? Consider that there are
around <m>10^{23}</m> gas molecules in a typical balloon, and they are
moving quite fast at typical room temperatures (see <xref ref="example_vtherm">Example</xref>). There are a <em>lot</em> of collisions occurring
each second between gas molecules and the inside of the balloon.
The result of all of these collisions is an outward force exerted on
the balloon fabric by the gas molecules. This outward gas force
opposes the inward components of the tension <em>and</em> the inward
force due to the collisions of all the gas molecules on the outside,
and as a result the balloon does not collapse.

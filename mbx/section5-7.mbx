<title>The Ideal Gas Law</title>
<p>
Now that we know how it is that a gas can exert a pressure, we
can use these ideas <mdash /> along with the previous discussion of
thermal velocities of gas molecules <mdash /> to calculate how the
pressure relates to the temperature of the gas, the number of gas
molecules (or moles) and the geometry of the container holding the
gas. From this we will derive one of the most useful
relations in thermodynamics: the <em>ideal gas law</em>.
</p>

<p>
A collision with a wall is shown in Fig. <xref ref="fig_collide_wall"></xref>.
Note that the <m>x</m>-component of velocity changed sign, while the
<m>y</m>-component of the velocity was unchanged. If we focus on <m>v_x</m>,
we can see that the molecules in Fig. <xref ref="fig_gas_pressure"></xref> will
bounce off the shaded wall and change the sign of <m>v_x</m>, then a time
<m>L/v_x</m> later they will bounce off the back wall and head back toward
the shaded wall. They will likely bounce off the side walls en
route, but this has no effect on <m>v_x</m>, so we can ignore it. Thus
the time between collisions on the shaded wall is <m>\Delta t = 2L/v_x</m>
(the factor of two coming from the trip away and then back).
</p>

<p>
The force on the wall due to the particle is zero in between
collisions, and then very abruptly some non-zero value during the
collision. Viewed as a function of time, the force would be a series
of spikes, since each collision is short in duration, and then there
is no force while the particle travels to the other side of the
container and back again. What we feel as steady pressure is the time
average of many collisions, so we would like to obtain an average of
this force over time.
</p>

of velocity is unchanged.</caption>

</figure>
<p>
We can calculate this time averaged force first by noting that the force
of the molecule on the wall is, by Newton's third law, equal and opposite
the force of the wall on the molecule. The force of the wall on the molecule
causes a change in the <m>x</m>-component of momentum, <m>p_x</m> (see
Fig. <xref ref="fig_collide_wall"></xref>). Note that the symbol <m>p</m> here, and in the
next two equations, refers to momentum, not pressure. We apologize for
the fact that the standard symbols for these quantities are the same
(but there are only so many letters to use). The momentum change is
given by
<men>
  \Delta  p_x  = - mv_x - m v_x = -2mv_x.
</men>
</p>

<p>
This momentum change happens once every time interval of <m>\Delta t =
2L/v_x</m> (the travel time between collisions), so we can conclude the
average force of the wall on the molecule is
<men>
  F_{{ avg},x} = m a_\text{ avg } = \frac{m \Delta v_x}{\Delta t} =\frac{\Delta p_x}{\Delta t} = -\frac{2mv_x}{2L/v_x} =
-\frac{mv_x^2}{L}.
</men>
</p>

<p>
The average force of the <em>molecule on the wall</em> is then
equal and opposite. If we consider all <m>N</m> molecules, then we can
conclude
<men>
  F_{\text{ on wall } ,x} = \sum_i \frac{m v_{i,x}^2}{L}
</men>
where <m>v_{i,x}</m> is the <m>x</m>-component of the velocity <m>\vec v_i</m> of the
<m>i</m>th particle.
We can appeal to the equipartition theorem, which tells us
<men>
  \Bigl\langle\sum_i {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}} m v_x^2\Bigr\rangle = N
\bigl({\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}k_BT\bigr),
</men>
and so the average force on the wall is given by
<men>
  F_{\text{ on wall } ,x} = \frac{Nk_BT}{L}.
</men>
</p>

<p>
Finally, we use the definition of pressure to conclude
<men>
  p = \frac{F_{\text{ on wall } ,x}}{A} = \frac{Nk_BT}{AL} = \frac{Nk_BT}{V}
</men>
where we have used <m>V=AL</m> (see Fig. <xref ref="fig_gas_pressure"></xref>). This
last relation holds regardless of the shape of the container, and we
have thus derived the <em>ideal gas law</em>
<men xml:id="eq_ideal_gas_law" >
  pV = N k_BT \qquad \text{ or } \qquad pV = nRT.
</men>
</p>

<p>
This is another universal law where the details of the molecules are
irrelevant: the molecular mass canceled out, and any interaction
forces between the molecules negligible as long as the gas is dilute
enough.
</p>

<p>
This is an extremely accurate law for most gases at room temperature and
higher temperatures. Note also that it does not depend on the mass of
the gas molecule, or whether it is diatomic or monatomic.
</p>

<p>
In Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_ideal_gas_law" />, both sides of the equations have units
of energy. If we use SI units, pressure should be measured in pascal,
and volume should be measured in cubic meters. However, we may take
advantage of the relation
<men>
  1\units{J} = (1\units{Pa})(1\units{m$^3$}) = 
(10^{-3}\units{kPa})(10^3\units{L}) = (1\units{kPa})(1\units{L}),
</men>
where <m>L</m> is liters. This tells us we can use kilopascals and liters and
the product <m>pV</m> will turn out to be joules.
</p>

<example>
<statement>
<p>
{Volume of a Mole of Gas}
Calculate the volume in liters occupied by a mole of ideal gas at a
temperature of <m>22^\circ\units{C}</m> and atmospheric pressure.
</p>

<p>
<em>Solution: </em> Starting from Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_ideal_gas_law" />, we solve for
<m>V</m>:
<men>
  V = \frac{nRT}{p} = \frac{(1\units{mol})(8.31\units{J/mol$\cdot$K})
      (295\units{K})}{101\units{kPa}} = 24.2\units{L}.
</men>
</p>

<p>
Note that we had to convert temperature from Celsius to Kelvin in
this calculation. <em>This is important:</em> you <em>always</em> have to
use Kelvin for the temperature when using the ideal gas law.
</p>
</statement>
</example>

<p>
\begin{exampleb}{Using Ratios in the Ideal Gas Law}
An ideal gas at a temperature <m>50^{\circ}</m> C is in a car piston.
The piston compresses the gas to 1/3 of its original volume. The
pressure increases by a factor of 5 during this process. Calculate
the new temperature of the gas in the piston.
</p>

<p>
<em>Solution: </em> We don't know the volume, pressure or number of moles of
gas at any point in this problem, so we will have to solve this
problem using ratios.
</p>

<p>
First, we need to convert temperature to Kelvin: <m>T = (50+273)
  \units{K} = 323 \units{K}</m>. Next, write down the ideal gas law: <m>pV
  = nRT</m>. We are interested ultimately in the final temperature, so
re-write this as:
<men>
  T = \frac{pV}{nR}
</men>
</p>

<p>
This holds both initially and after the compression, so <m>T_1 =
  p_1V_1/(n_1R)</m> and <m>T_2 = p_2V_2/(n_2R)</m>.
<men>
  \frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{\displaystyle\left(\frac{p_2V_2}{n_2R}\right) }
 {\displaystyle\left( \frac{p_1V_1}{n_1R}\right) } 
  = \frac{p_2}{p_1}\frac{V_2}{V_1},
</men>
since <m>n_2 = n_1</m> and <m>R</m> is a constant. So, the final temperature is
<men>
  T_2 = T_1 \cdot \frac{p_2}{p_1}\cdot\frac{V_2}{V_1} = 
  (323\units{K})\cdot 5 \cdot \frac{1}{3}
  = 538 \units{K} ,
</men>
or <m>(538 - 273)^{\circ}\units{C} = 265^{\circ}\units{C}</m>.
</p>

<p>
Note that when using ratios to determine a new value for the pressure
or volume, it doesn't matter what units we use for those quantities
because the units will cancel between numerator and denominator.
Though it is still always necessary to use Kelvin for temperature.

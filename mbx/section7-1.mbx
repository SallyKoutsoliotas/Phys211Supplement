<title>Introduction</title>
<p>
Mechanical energy is essential for our every day life: cars move
along roads and highways, electrons flow through
semiconductor devices in our iPods,
and blood flows through our arteries. Mechanical energy makes matter
do things, and converting other forms of energy to mechanical energy
is an essential technological challenge. Batteries and our bodies
convert chemical bond energy into mechanical energy. And nuclear reactors
convert mass into mechanical energy.
</p>

<p>
But we have seen that there is a considerable amount of energy
contained in the disorganized thermal motion of the molecules and the
disorganized pushes and pulls on their molecular neighbors.
Harnessing some of this thermal energy and converting it to organized
mechanical energy provides yet another source of mechanical energy.
But just how do we go about doing this?
</p>

<p>
It is tempting to imagine some kind of molecular referee who could
convince the all the molecules in a material to align their motion.
If the molecules in your textbook could do this, your book would zip
away from you at many hundreds of miles per hour, so it would be a
very useful trick. However, no such microscopic referee exists. In
fact, this trick would violate the second law of thermodynamics,
moving from a more probable to a less probable arrangement of
velocities.<fn>This microscopic referee was first pondered by
  Maxwell, and is commonly referred to as Maxwell's Demon.  He showed
  that the referee could make heat flow from a colder object to a
  hotter one <mdash /> in contradiction to the second law, which of course
  is impossible.</fn>
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, it is still possible to convert some (but not all)
thermal energy to mechanical energy. That is, we can design devices
to do this while still satisfying the second law. These devices are
called <em>heat engines</em>, and they played an essential role in the
industrial revolution and continue to play a vital role in modern
society.
</p>

<p>
In this chapter we will study the basic physics behind heat engines.
We will discuss how the basic principle of a heat engine can be
understood using the arguments of statistics and entropy discussed in
<xref ref="chapter_second_law">Chapter</xref>. We will also describe the basic gas
cycles that many such engines employ. As a fundamental starting
point, any heat engine must satisfy the second law of thermodynamics,
<m>\Delta S_\text{ total }  \ge 0</m>, so we begin with developing a
convenient and powerful relationship between entropy change and heat.

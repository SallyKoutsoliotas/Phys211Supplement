<title>Entropy Change and Heat</title>
<p>
As discussed in the previous chapter, entropy is a measure of
probability; specifically, it is Boltzmann's constant times the
logarithm of the multiplicity. While we can work with the
multiplicity and take logarithms for simple enough models, we often
want to know the entropy (actually, the entropy <em>change</em> <m>\Delta
S</m>) for more complicated situations without having to sort out exactly
what is going on with the multiplicity.
</p>

<p>
In many situations it is possible to do this. We begin with our
result from the previous chapter:
<men>
  \frac{1}{T} = \frac{dS}{dE_\text{ therm } },
</men>
which we can rewrite as a relation between a small (infinitesimal) entropy
change <m>dS</m> and a small thermal energy change <m>dE_\text{ therm }</m>,
<men xml:id="eq_dSdEtherm" >
  dS = \frac{dE_\text{ therm } }{T} \qquad(W=0).
</men>
</p>

<p>
In our development of the definition of temperature, we only
considered energy transfers between subsystems <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> that
happened spontaneously, due to the increased probability associated
with the new energy distribution. In other words, we only allowed for
thermal energy changes due to <em>heat</em> and not due to <em>work</em>.
Hence the <m>W=0</m> label in Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_dSdEtherm" />.
</p>

<p>
Recall that the first law of thermodynamics, for small amounts of heat
and work, says
<men>
  dE_\text{ therm }  = dQ + dW.
</men>
</p>

<p>
If no work is being done, <m>dE_\text{ therm }</m> is the same thing as <m>dQ</m>:
the thermal energy has changed by however much heat flow has occurred.
Thus, we could equally well write Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_dSdEtherm" /> with a <m>dQ</m>
in the numerator.
</p>

<p>
So the question is, what is the appropriate generalization of
Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_dSdEtherm" /> to cases where there is both heat flow and
work done? Should the numerator still be <m>dE_\text{ therm }</m>, or should
it be <m>dQ</m>, or something else entirely?
</p>

<p>
The answer is: it depends. If the work is being done slowly enough
that the system remains in thermal equilibrium (which means that the
basic hypothesis of all microstates being equally likely is at all
times still true), then we have a clear answer: the numerator should
be <m>dQ</m>, and so
<men xml:id="eq_dSdQ" >
  dS = \frac{dQ}{T}  \qquad\text{ (whether or not \(W=0\)) } .
</men>
</p>

<p>
A good rule of thumb for <q>slow enough</q> is that whatever moving
object is doing the work should move slower than the speed of sound.
In many cases this isn't much of a limitation. For our purposes, we
will assume that we remain in equilibrium for all the processes we
consider.<fn>When this isn't the case, and the system goes out
  of equilibrium, we do not have a general expression for the change
  in entropy.  This is an active area of research today!</fn>
</p>

<p>
But you may be wondering why doing work (slowly enough) doesn't affect
the entropy, that is, <m>\Delta S</m> only depends on the heat flow. The
full explanation is beyond the scope of this course, but here is the
flavor of it. We could do work on a solid by squeezing it, and this
would certainly increase the thermal energy. The Einstein solid of
the previous chapter would respond to the squeezing by having an
increased energy spacing <m>\epsilon</m>, but not by having more <q>energy
units.</q> So the multiplicity wouldn't change, even though the thermal
energy has gone up. And of course if the multiplicity doesn't change,
the entropy doesn't change.
</p>

<p>
In practical terms, Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_dSdQ" /> is a very handy tool for
calculating entropy changes. Of course, we usually have more than a
small amount of heat flow, so we will need to use calculus to add up
the net entropy change:
<men xml:id="eq_DeltaSgeneral" >
  \Delta S = S_B - S_A = \int_A^B dS = \int_A^B \frac{dQ}{T}.
\qquad\text{ (equilibrium processes) }
</men>
</p>

<p>
Often we are considering constant temperature situations, and then
this result simplifies even further:
<men xml:id="eq_deltaS_isothermal" >
  \Delta S= \frac{1}{T}\int dQ = \frac{Q}{T} \qquad\text{ (constant temperature) }
</men>
</p>

<p>
The sign of <m>Q</m> is important here! When <m>Q</m> is positive, <m>\Delta S</m>
is positive, and when <m>Q</m> is negative, <m>\Delta S</m> is negative. Or to
put it another way: heat flow in increases the entropy, and heat flow
out decreases the entropy. <em>Do not forget this!</em> The second law
is commonly misunderstood to say that all entropies must always
increase. This is simply not true. The second law only tell us the
<em>total</em> entropy must increase.
</p>

<p>
There are three common situations where the temperature is constant,
even though heat is flowing in or out of the system.
<ul>
<li><p><em>for an isothermal process</em> <mdash /> isothermal expansion or
  contraction of a gas is, by definition, at constant temperature (iso
  = <q>equal</q>, thermal = <q>temperature</q>).</p></li>
<li><p><em>during a phase change</em> <mdash /> the latent heat at a phase
  transition (e.g., melting/solidifying or vaporizing/condensing)
  keeps the temperature constant.</p></li>
<li><p><em>for a thermal reservoir</em> <mdash /> if a system is very large,
  modest amounts of heat flow will not affect the temperature.  For
  example, dumping a cup of coffee into the ocean will not change the
  ocean's temperature measurably.</p></li>
</ul>

<example>
<statement>
<p>
{Entropy Change of Melting Ice}
Consider an <m>18\units{g}</m> ice cube at <m>0^\circ\units{C}</m>. Heat
flows in until is has changed phase to <m>0^\circ\units{C}</m> water.
The water molecules are now free to wander, which increases their
number of possible microstates. How much has the entropy increased?
</p>

<p>
<em>Solution: </em> Since the molar mass of H<m>_2</m>O is <m>18\units{g}</m>, our ice
cube contains one mole. Thus the heat required to melt it is (via
<xref ref="table_phase_transitions">Table</xref>)
<men>
  Q = n L_f = 1\units{mol} \cdot 6.01\units{kJ/mol} = 6010 \units{J}.
</men>
</p>

<p>
Now we can find the entropy change
<men>
  \Delta S = S_\text{ water }  - S_\text{ ice } = \frac{Q}{T}=
\frac{6010\units{J}}{273\units{K}}= 22.0 \units{J/K}.
</men>
</p>

<p>
Note that we have to use Kelvin for this to work.
</p>
</statement>
</example>

<p>
In some cases, however, <m>T</m> is changing while the heat flows. In this
case we must evaluate some kind of integral to find <m>\Delta S</m>. We
will restrict ourselves to the cases where no work is being done and
there is no phase change (i.e., nothing melting, solidifying,
condensing or vaporizing). That is, heat is flowing in or out of a
solid or liquid, whose volumes are essentially constant. In this
case,
<men>
  dQ = dE_\text{ therm }  = nC\,dT
</men>
that is, we can relate the small heat flow to a small temperature
change. Putting this into our integral expression gives
<men>
  \Delta S = \int_A^B \frac{dQ}{T}= \int_{T_A}^{T_B} \frac{nC\,dT}{T}
</men>
</p>

<p>
Since the specific heat usually is nearly constant with respect to
temperature, we may bring it outside of the integral:
<men>
  \Delta S = nC\int_{T_A}^{T_B} \frac{dT}{T} = nC(\ln T_B -\ln T_A)
 = nC\ln(T_B/T_A).
</men>
</p>

<p>
Note that when the temperature increases, <m>\Delta S</m> is positive,
while when the temperature decreases, <m>\Delta S</m> is negative, since
the natural log of a number less than one is negative.
</p>

<example>
<statement>
<p>
{Entropy Change from Heating Water}
Let's pick up with that <m>18\units{g}</m> of <m>0^\circ\units{C}</m> water,
and now add heat until it has become <m>100^\circ\units{C}</m> water (but
not yet started to boil). How much does the entropy increase?
</p>

<p>
<em>Solution: </em> We have one mole of water, and we get the molar specific
heat of water from <xref ref="table_liquid_specific_heats">Table</xref>. We need
to use Kelvin for our temperature units, so
<md>
  <mrow>  \Delta S \amp = nC\ln(T_f/T_i) = 1\units{mol}\cdot  75.3\units{J/mol$\cdot$K}
  \cdot\ln\left(\frac{373\units{K}}{273\units{K}}\right) \nonumber</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp = 23.5\units{J/K}</mrow>
</md>
</p>

<p>
Notice in this case we didn't need to calculate the amount of heat
flow involved.
</p>
</statement>
</example>

<p>
One final special case in which entropy changes are easy to calculate
is for a <em>cyclic</em> process, i.e., a process where the system (or
part of the system) ends up in the same state that it started in. In
this case,
<men xml:id="eq_DeltaS_cyclic" >
  \Delta S_\text{ cyclic }  = 0
\qquad\text{ (cyclic processes) }
</men>

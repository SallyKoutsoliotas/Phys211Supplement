<title>Second Law and Heat Flow</title>
<p>
Our new relatively simple relation between heat flow and entropy
change can be directly brought back to the second law. Recall the
Clausius statement of the second law, that heat can only spontaneously
flow from higher temperature to lower temperature. Suppose we have a
pair of bricks <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> with temperatures <m>T_A=400\units{K}</m> and
<m>T_B=300\units{K}</m>. We bring the bricks into thermal contact and let
<m>20\units{J}</m> of heat flow from the higher temperature brick to the
lower temperature brick. This is a small enough amount of energy that
the temperature of the bricks is essentially unchanged (they are
acting as reservoirs), so we can use the constant temperature
approximation (Eq. <xref ref="eq_deltaS_isothermal"></xref>) for entropy changes.
</p>

<p>
Then the total entropy change is
<md>
  <mrow>  \Delta S_\text{ total } \amp = \Delta S_A + \Delta S_B = \frac{Q_A}{T_A} +
\frac{Q_B}{T_B} \nonumber</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp = \frac{-20\units{J}}{400\units{K}} + \frac{+20\units{J}}{300\units{K}} 
= -0.050\units{J/K} + 0.067\units{J/K} \nonumber</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp = 0.017\units{J/K}.</mrow>
</md>
</p>

<p>
Notice the signs of <m>Q_A</m> and <m>Q_B</m>: since heat was flowing out of
brick <m>A</m>, <m>Q_A</m> is negative. We find that even though the entropy of
brick <m>A</m> went down, the total entropy of bricks <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> went up,
as required by the second law.
</p>

<p>
If we had tried, as a thought experiment, to send the <m>20\units{J}</m> in
the other direction, this would have changed all the signs, and we
would be confronted with a <m>\Delta S_\text{ total } \lt 0</m>, violating the
second law.
</p>

<p>
More generally, for some amount <m>Q</m> flowing from reservoir <m>A</m> to
reservoir <m>B</m>, we have
<men>
  \Delta S_\text{ total } = \frac{-Q}{T_A} + \frac{Q}{T_B}= 
  Q\left(\frac{1}{T_B}-\frac{1}{T_A}\right)
</men>
</p>

<p>
Since the second law requires <m>\Delta S_\text{ total } \geq 0</m>, we see
that <m>T_A</m> must be greater than <m>T_B</m> for this to happen. And so we
have recovered the Clausius statement of the second law, i.e.,
that heat can flow spontaneously only from higher to lower
temperature.

<title>Heat Engines</title>
<p>
Let's return to the question at the beginning of the chapter: how can
we harness some of the thermal energy of some object and convert it to
mechanical energy? We know how to spontaneously decrease the thermal
energy of an object: put it into contact with something at a lower
temperature. So we can extract thermal energy as <em>heat</em>, but that
doesn't yet give us <em>mechanical energy</em>, which is what we are
after. We need somehow to transform heat to work: start with the
spontaneous energy flow due to a temperature difference, but convert
it to something that will turn a crank or generate electricity or lift
a weight. Once we have energy available in the form of work, we can
use it to manipulate mechanical energy however we like.
</p>

<p>
Can we simply convert all the heat to work? The first law of
thermodynamics, a.k.a. energy conservation, would have no problem with
this. This hypothetical engine is illustrated in
Fig. <xref ref="fig_impossible_engine"></xref>. In both scenarios in this figure,
the hot reservoir is giving off heat <m>Q</m>, and so has negative entropy
change. Since we are dealing with a reservoir, we use the
constant temperature approximation (Eq. <xref ref="eq_deltaS_isothermal"></xref>) to find
<men>
  \Delta S_H = -\frac{|Q|}{T_H}.
</men>
</p>

<p>
(We use absolute value bars so that there no confusion about the sign
of <m>Q</m>). For the figure on the left, this negative entropy change is
allowed, because it is offset by the positive entropy change of the
cold reservoir, <m>\Delta S_C=|Q|/T_C</m>. But for the figure on the
right, there is no compensating positive entropy change. And so if we
could convert all heat to work, then
<men>
  \Delta S_\text{ total }  = \Delta S_H = -\frac{|Q|}{T_H} \lt  0
</men>
which violates the second law! So we cannot do this.
</p>

<p>
But, you may have noticed that we could still satisfy the second law in
the previous example even if we didn't dump all of the heat <m>Q</m> into the
cold reservoir. Suppose we only dumped enough heat to make the positive
<m>\Delta S_C</m> large enough to compensate for the negative <m>\Delta S_H</m>.
That would leave a little energy that we could conceivably convert to
work, while satisfying the second law (and the first, for that matter).
</p>

<p>
A schematic diagram of this process <mdash /> called an <em>engine diagram</em>
<mdash /> is shown in Fig. <xref ref="fig_engine_diagram"></xref>. An amount of heat
<m>Q_H</m> is pulled from the hot reservoir, and an amount <m>Q_C</m> is dumped
into the cold reservoir. In between, some device which we'll call the
working substance intercepts this heat and produces work. For now,
don't worry about how this might actually be accomplished; we'll
discuss that in detail in the next section. Instead, focus on the big
picture: such a device will be consistent with the first law as long
as we conserve energy. Looking at the arrows for energy flow, this
tells us
<men>
  |Q_H| = |Q_C| + |W|. \qquad\text{ (first law) }
</men>
</p>

<p>
Again, we have used absolute value bars everywhere to avoid ambiguity about
whether the symbol <m>Q_H</m> represent the heat flow out of the hot
reservoir (in which case it is a negative value), or the heat flow in
to the work substance (in which case it is positive).
</p>
<figure xml:id="fig_engine_diagram" >
<caption>Engine diagram.</caption>
<image width="45%" source="images/engine_diagram.png" />
</figure>
<p>
And continuing with the big picture: such a device will be consistent
with the second law as long as the total entropy doesn't decrease. So
where do entropy changes happen? Certainly in the reservoirs. The
hot reservoir has an entropy decrease (since heat leaves the
reservoir) and the cold reservoir has an entropy increase
(since heat is added to the reservoir). But what about the
working substance? This gets at an
essential point: in order to be a heat engine, the working substance is <em> not</em> a source of energy. It's not a battery stuck in between the
reservoirs, or anything else consuming chemical energy. Rather, it
must be returned back to the same state it started from, so the
process can be repeated indefinitely. But if this is the case, if the
working substance undergoes some cyclic process, then we
can use Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_DeltaS_cyclic" />, which tells us <m>\Delta
S_\text{ w.s. } =0</m>, since the final and initial states are the same.
</p>

<p>
And now we can do the complete entropy accounting:
<men xml:id="eq_engine_second_law" >
  \Delta S_\text{ total } = \Delta S_H + \Delta S_C + 
  \cancelto{0}{\Delta S}_\text{ w.s. } 
  = -\frac{|Q_H|}{T_H}+ \frac{|Q_C|}{T_C}  \geq 0 \text{ (second
    law) }
</men>
</p>

<p>
One way to think of Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_engine_second_law" /> is that it gives
a lower bound on how much heat we have to dump to the cold reservoir:
<men>
  |Q_C| \geq \frac{T_C}{T_H}|Q_H|.
</men>
</p>

<p>
That lower bound isn't zero, so we must dump some heat.
<em>This is an important result</em>: any heat engine <em>must</em>
dump some of its heat into a cold reservoir. It is impossible
to turn all heat into usable mechanical energy.
</p>

<p>
But the good news is that the lower bound on the dumped heat <m>|Q_C|</m>
is smaller than <m>|Q_H|</m>, so we do get to <q>skim off</q> some of the
energy and generate some work. Notice that the bound on how much heat
we have to dump becomes smaller for very large <m>T_H</m> or small <m>T_C</m>.
Evidently, the more extreme the difference in temperature between the
reservoir, the more work we will be able to extract.
</p>

<p>
Let's quantify that. Let's introduce a dimensionless quantity called
the efficiency, which is simply the fraction of heat pulled out of the
hot reservoir that we are able to convert to work:
<men xml:id="eq_efficiency_def" >
  \epsilon \equiv \frac{|W|}{|Q_H|}.
</men>
</p>

<p>
From the first law we know <m>|W|=|Q_H|-|Q_C|</m>, so we can substitute
this in and write the efficiency equivalently as
<men xml:id="eq_general_efficiency" >
  \epsilon = \frac{|Q_H|-|Q_C|}{|Q_H|} = 1 - \frac{|Q_C|}{|Q_H|}.
</men>
</p>

<p>
Obviously, the efficiency can't ever be greater than 1;
that would correspond to an engine that produces more mechanical energy
than the amount of heat that flows into it, and that would violate the
first law of thermodynamics. But since <m>|Q_C|</m> can never be zero in
a real engine <mdash /> we must always dump some heat <mdash /> the efficiency can
never reach 1. That would violate the second law of thermodynamics.
We'll say more about this in a bit, after we have done a simple example
using efficiency.
</p>

<example xml:id="ex_simple_engine">
<statement>
<p>
{A simple engine problem}
</p>
<figure xml:id="fig_engine_for_example" >
<caption>Diagram for <xref ref="ex_simple_engine">Example</xref></caption>
<image width="20%" source="images/engine_for_example.png" />
</figure>
<p>
An engine is described by the engine diagram in
Fig. <xref ref="fig_engine_for_example"></xref>. Determine the work output by this
engine and the efficiency of the engine.
</p>

<p>
<em>Solution: </em>
We can straightforwardly find the work done
by this engine using the first law of thermodynamics, i.e., energy
conservation. The energy going into the working substance is
equal to the energy going out of the working substance, so
<men>
  |Q_H| = |Q_C| + |W|
</men>
and
<men>
  |W| = |Q_H| - |Q_C| = 250\units{J} - 175\units{J} = 75\units{J} .
</men>
</p>

<p>
Then from the definition of efficiency, Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_efficiency_def" />,
we have
<me>
  \epsilon = \frac{|W|}{|Q_H|}  = \frac{75\units{J}}{250\units{J}} = 0.30.
</me>
</p>
</statement>
</example>

<p>
Okay, so we have a definition for efficiency, which can never be
greater than one (that would violate the first law of thermodynamics).
But it can never <em>be equal to</em> 1 either.<fn>This is
  important: if you ever calculate an efficiency equal to or greater
  than one, then it is wrong.</fn> The maximum value of <m>\epsilon</m>
corresponds to <m>|Q_C|</m> being at its minimum (since it is being subtracted).
Evidently,
<men xml:id="eq_max_efficiency" >
  \epsilon_\text{ max }  = 1 - \frac{|Q_{C,{ min}}|}{|Q_H|} = 1 -
\frac{(T_C/T_H)|Q_H|}{|Q_H|} = 1-\frac{T_C}{T_H}.
</men>
</p>

<p>
Warning: do not confuse this result for the maximum efficiency
<m>\epsilon_\text{ max }</m> with the similar looking expression
Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_general_efficiency" /> for efficiency <m>\epsilon</m> in general.
Also, this is only valid if heat is drawn from and dumped into
isothermal reservoirs.
</p>

<p>
It is worth keeping in mind that Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_max_efficiency" /> for the
maximum efficiency is really a special case of an engine operating
between two thermal reservoirs. A more general approach is just to
use the first and second laws of thermodynamics. The first law just says
balance the energy in and the energy out, and the second law says
<men>
  \Delta S_\text{ total }  = 0 \qquad\text{ (maximum efficiency) }
</men>
</p>

<p>
Ultimately, that's the one equation you need to remember
to solve problems involving a maximally efficient engine.
</p>

<p>
Let's consider some examples:
</p>

<example xml:id="example_automobile_efficiency">
<statement>
<p>
{Automobile Efficiency} The internal combustion engine of an automobile is a heat engine.
Yes, there is gas being consumed, but that's being burned to provide
the high temperature of the hot reservoir. From there on, the engine
functions as a heat engine.
</p>

<p>
The hot reservoir is about <m>820^\circ\units{C}</m> and the cold reservoir
is almost air temperature, but typically more like
<m>70^\circ\units{C}</m>. Burning a gallon of gasoline provides about
<m>120\units{MJ}</m> of heat. What is the upper limit on how much work can
be extracted from a gallon of gas, and how much heat must be dumped?
</p>

<p>
<em>Solution: </em> The moment you see the words <q>upper limit</q> (or similar
language), then you can pull out the second law of thermodynamics:
<m>\Delta S_\text{ total }  = 0</m>. For this problem, <m>\Delta S_\text{ total } 
= \Delta S_H + \Delta S_C</m>, since the reservoirs are the
only parts of this system whose entropy changes.
</p>

<p>
To calculate <m>\Delta S</m> for the reservoirs, we need to convert the
temperatures to Kelvin, so <m>T_H=820+273=1093\units{K}</m> and
<m>T_C=70+273=343\units{K}</m>. The entropy change of the hot reservoir is
<men>
  \Delta S_H = \frac{-|Q_H|}{T_H} = 
-\frac{120\times 10^6\units{J}}{1093\units{K}}
 = -1.10\times 10^{5}\units{J/K}
</men>
</p>

<p>
Therefore, since <m>\Delta S_\text{ total }  = 0</m>, it follows that
<m>\Delta S_C</m> must be positive by at least this amount.
<men>
  \Delta S_{C,{ min}} = \frac{|Q_{C,{ min}}|}{T_C} = 1.10\times
10^5\units{J/K}
</men>
so
<men>
  |Q_{C,{ min}}| = 343\units{K} \cdot 1.10\times 10^{5}\units{J/K} =
37.7\units{MJ}.
</men>
</p>

<p>
We get the maximum work by subtracting this from <m>|Q_H|</m>:
<men>
  |W_\text{ max } | = 120 - 37.7 = 82\units{MJ}.
</men>
</p>

<p>
In reality, the work output is only about 1/3 of this amount, due to
(i) design choices to get the work out faster, i.e. to get more power,
(ii) friction, and (iii) imperfect combustion of the fuel.
</p>
</statement>
</example>

<p>
We could have solved the previous example by using the equation for
<m>\epsilon_\text{ max }</m> for engines with thermal reservoirs (although
there was no need to do so). The following is an example where
the <m>\epsilon_\text{ max }</m> approach would not work; i.e., you
<em>must</em> start from the second law of thermodynamics:
</p>

<example xml:id="example_two_brick_heat_engine">
<statement>
<p>
{A Two-Brick Heat Engine} A hot brick initially at temperature <m>T_H=400\units{K}</m> is used as
the source for a heat engine. An equal sized cold brick made of the
same material, initially at temperature <m>T_C=300\units{K}</m>, is used
to dump the waste heat. As the heat flows, the two bricks come to
thermal equilibrium. Assuming the heat engine was maximally
efficient, what is the final temperature?
</p>

<p>
<em>Solution: </em> You might think the final temperature should just be
<m>350\units{K}</m>, but that would be true only if we didn't intercept
any of the heat and convert it to work.
</p>

<p>
There is a lot we aren't given. We don't know the amounts
or the composition of the bricks, but we know they are identical.
The hotter brick is going to cool from <m>400\units{K}</m> down to some
<m>T_f</m>, so its entropy change will be <m>\Delta S_H = nC\ln(T_f/400)</m>,
which is negative since <m>T_f/400\lt 1</m>. The colder brick will warm
from <m>300\units{K}</m> to <m>T_f</m>, so its entropy change will be <m>\Delta
  S_C=nC\ln(T_f/300)</m>. For maximum efficiency, then,
<men>
  \Delta S_\text{ total }  = \Delta S_H+ \Delta S_C =
nC\ln\left(\frac{T_f}{400}\right) + nC\ln\left(\frac{T_f}{300}\right)
= 0.
</men>
</p>

<p>
The <m>nC</m> factors divide out, and we get
<men>
  \ln T_f - \ln 400 + \ln T_f - \ln 300 = 0
</men>
and so
<md>
  <mrow>  2\ln T_f = \ln(400\cdot 300) \amp \Rightarrow\amp  
T_f^2=400\cdot 300  \nonumber</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp \Rightarrow\amp  T_f = 346.4\units{K}.</mrow>
</md>
</p>

<p>
We see that the bricks end up slightly cooler than <m>350\units{K}</m>,
which makes sense since we skimmed off some of the energy as it was
flowing from hot to cold.

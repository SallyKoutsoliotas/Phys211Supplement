<title>Refrigerators</title>
<p>
An interesting thing happens if we take a heat engine and run it
backwards: we make a refrigerator. By refrigerator, we mean a device
which requires work as input and is able to make heat flow from a
colder object to a hotter object. This includes, of course, the
refrigerator that keeps your milk from getting spoiled, but also
includes air conditioners and even heat pumps (which is basically an
air conditioner hooked up backwards to cool the outdoors and warm
your house).
</p>

<p>
Making heat flow from cold to hot may sound like a violation of
Clausius's statement of the second law, but it is not as long as
something else is going on in the process. Heat will not
<em>spontaneously</em> flow from cold to hot; rather, we must cleverly
engineer the refrigerator to make it happen and, most importantly, we
must plug it in, to give the necessary work as input.

<p>
Let's start with an engine diagram in reverse, as shown in
Fig. <xref ref="fig_refrigerator_diagram"></xref>, and focus on the first and second
laws. Energy conservation now requires
<men>
  |Q_C| + |W| = |Q_H| \qquad\qquad\text{ (first law) }
</men>
which is exactly the same equation as before, since we reversed <em> all</em> the arrows. Now the signs of the entropy change in the
reservoir are reversed, so the second law says
<men>
  \Delta S_\text{ total }  = \Delta S_H + \Delta S_C = 
 \frac{|Q_H|}{T_H} - \frac{|Q_C|}{T_C} \geq 0.\text{ (second law) }
</men>
</p>

<p>
This now provides an <em>upper</em> bound on <m>|Q_C|</m>, namely
<men xml:id="eq_qc_upper_bound" >
  |Q_C| \leq \frac{T_C}{T_H}|Q_H|.
</men>
</p>

<p>
What does this mean? It means we can run a heat engine backwards and
satisfy the first and second laws and actually make some heat go from
cold to hot. But there is a limitation on how much heat we can pull
out of the cold reservoir, and this limitation depends on the
reservoir temperatures and on how much work we provide. If we
eliminate <m>|Q_H|</m> from the upper bound, Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_qc_upper_bound" />,
we can show
<men xml:id="eq_qc_upper_bound_ii" >
  |Q_C| \leq \frac{T_C}{T_H-T_C} |W|,
</men>
which you will derive in the homework. This expression says that we
need work to pull heat out of the cold reservoir, and also that the
effectiveness of pulling out heat will depend on the reservoir
temperatures. We can quantify this <q>effectiveness</q> with what is
called the coefficient of performance, <m>CP</m>, defined as the ratio of
what want (<m>|Q_C|</m>) to what we must pay (<m>|W|</m>):
<men>
  CP = \frac{|Q_C|}{|W|} \leq  \frac{T_C}{T_H-T_C}.
</men>
</p>

<p>
As before, the maximum coefficient of performance is obtained from the
borderline case of the second law <m>\Delta S_\text{ total } =0</m>.
Notice that reservoirs that are close in temperature yield a larger
<m>CP</m>. This makes sense, since the closer <m>T_H</m> and <m>T_C</m> are, the
less <q>uphill</q> we are making the heat flow.
</p>

<p>
In the refrigerator diagram the working substance now goes
through a counterclockwise gas cycle. This allows for the heat to
flow into the gas while it is at a lower temperature (lower than
<m>T_C</m>) and heat to flow out of the gas while it is at a higher
temperature (higher than <m>T_H</m>). But this counterclockwise cycle also
means compression happens at higher pressure than the expansion. This
will require some outside source of work to drive the gas through this
cycle, which is exactly what we found from general first law and
second law considerations: work input is necessary to make the
refrigerator function. In other words, your refrigerator won't function
properly if you forget to plug it in.

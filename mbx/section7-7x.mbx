<problem>
<statement>
<p>
Can you cool off your house by opening the door to the refrigerator?
Explain why or why not.
</p>
</statement>
</problem>

<problem>
<statement>
<p>
A refrigerator is designed to keep its interior at a constant
<m>5^\circ\units{C}</m> while dumping heat into a room temperature
environment at <m>22^\circ\units{C}</m>. The interior of
the refrigerator may be regarded as a cold reservoir,
while the air around it is a
hot reservoir. Now suppose a pitcher containing <m>1800\units{g}</m> of
room-temperature water is put into the refrigerator. We can break
down what happens next into two steps: (1) the water will cool down
to the temperature of the cold reservoir (fridge interior) as its
heat flows into cold reservoir, and (2) the refrigerator will turn
on and do work (run a compressor, circulate refrigerant, etc.) to
extract this heat from the cold interior and dump it to the air
outside.
</p>

<p>
We'll calculate what happens in each of these steps.
</p>

<p>
Step <hash />1:
<ol>
<li><p>Calculate the change in entropy of the water as it cools from 
<m>22^\circ\units{C}</m> to <m>5^\circ\units{C}</m>.</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate the change in entropy of the cold reservoir (i.e. the
inside of the refrigerator) due to this same heat transfer.</p></li>
<li><p>Is the second law of thermodynamics satisfied in this step?
Explain briefly why or why not, using your results above.</p></li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Step <hash />2
<ol>
<li><p>Now we must get rid of the extra heat in the cold reservoir 
  by   transferring  it  to  the  hot  reservoir.
  Calculate the change in the entropy of the cold reservoir
(refrigerator) as the excess heat
  from step <hash />1 is removed from the refrigerator's interior.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine the minimum amount  of work required to remove this 
excess heat
from the cold reservoir.</p></li>
</ol>

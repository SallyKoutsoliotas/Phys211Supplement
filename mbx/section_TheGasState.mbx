<title>The Gas State</title>
<p>
In the gas phase, most of the time the molecules are so far apart that
they exert no force on each other. The exception is the brief molecular
collision, where the pair potential plays a role in determining the forces
that they exert on each other during the collision. However, after the
collision the pair of molecules head off in their new directions with
new speeds, moving rather quickly out of range of each other and feeling
no force. The details of the molecular collisions are complicated,
but we can avoid having to worry about them by making use of the
equipartition theorem.
</p>

<p>
The total thermal energy for a gas is, to an excellent
approximation, purely kinetic, as the molecules are too far apart to
have an appreciable potential energy. However, the kinetic energy
may consist of both translational and rotational kinetic energies.
For a <em>monatomic</em> gas molecule, such as argon, there is no
contribution to rotational kinetic energy and so
<men xml:id="eq_monatomic_Emolecule" >
  E_\text{ molecule }  = K_\text{ trans }  = {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}} m v_x^2 + 
{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}} m v_y^2 + {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}} m v_z^2. 
\text{ (monatomic ideal gas) }
</men>
</p>

<p>
There are three quadratic contributions to the energy.
The equipartition theorem says, therefore, that the average thermal
energy per molecule is <m>3(\textstyle\frac{1}{2}k_BT)</m>. Therefore, the
total thermal energy is
<men xml:id="eq_monatomic_ideal_gas" >
  E_\text{ therm }  = N\langle
E_\text{ molecule } \rangle =
 {\textstyle\frac{3}{2}} N k_B T = {\textstyle\frac{3}{2}} n R T.
\text{ (monatomic ideal gas) }
</men>
</p>
<figure xml:id="fig_diatomic" >
<caption>Molecular nitrogen, N<m>_2</m>, has two distinct axes of rotation, 
both of which contribute to the molecular kinetic energy.</caption>
<image width="37%" source="images/diatomic.png" />
</figure>
<p>
However, many gas molecules are diatomic, such as N<m>_2</m>, which makes up
about 78<percent /> of our atmosphere, and O<m>_2</m>, which makes up most of the rest.
These dumbbell-shaped molecules have significant rotational kinetic energy
as well as translational kinetic energy, as shown in Fig. <xref ref="fig_diatomic"></xref>.
Their molecular energy is given by
<men xml:id="eq_diatomic_Emolecule" >
  E_\text{ molecule }  = {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}} m v_x^2 +
{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}} m v_y^2 + {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}} m v_z^2
+{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}} I_1 \omega_1^2 + {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}} I_2
\omega_2^2
\text{ (diatomic ideal gas) }
</men>
where <m>\omega_1</m> and <m>\omega_2</m> are the angular frequencies of the molecular
rotation about the two axes indicated in Fig. <xref ref="fig_diatomic"></xref>. The details
of the molecular mass or rotational inertia again do not matter, and
the equipartition theorem now gives
<men xml:id="eq_diatomic_ideal_gas" >
  E_\text{ therm }  = N\langle E_\text{ molecule } \rangle
 = {\textstyle\frac{5}{2}} N k_B T = {\textstyle\frac{5}{2}} n R T.
\text{ (diatomic ideal gas) }
</men>
</p>

<p>
These results can be combined into one expression,
<men xml:id="eq_EthermIdealGas" >
  E_\text{ therm }  = \frac{f}{2} Nk_BT = \frac{f}{2} nRT.\qquad\text{ (ideal gas) }
</men>
where <m>f</m> is the number of <em>degrees of freedom</em>, or the number of quadratic terms appearing in the energy of a molecule. So <m>f=3</m> for a monatomic
ideal gas, and <m>f=5</m> for a diatomic ideal gas.
</p>

<p>
Given the usual definition of molar specific heat, <m>\Delta E_\text{ therm } 
= n C\Delta T</m>, we may identify
<men>
  C_\text{ monatomic }  = {\textstyle\frac{3}{2}R} = 12.5\units{J/mol$\cdot$K}, 
\qquad
C_\text{ diatomic }  = {\textstyle\frac{5}{2}R} = 20.8\units{J/mol$\cdot$K}.
</men>
</p>

<p>
As <xref ref="table_gas_specific_heats">Table</xref> shows, these values are highly
accurate.

Here is an application:
Argon gas is the most abundant monatomic gas in the atmosphere, and is
technologically useful since monatomic gases conduct heat slower than
diatomic gases, due to the smaller heat capacity.
Modern double-glazed windows have argon gas between the two
sheets of glass, to minimize the rate of heat transfer through the
window.

In solids and liquids, sound waves move by molecules pushing on their
neighbors. In a gas, the molecules are not in contact with each other
to push and pull, and so sound propagation is fundamentally different:
the molecules must travel from collision to collision for the sound
wave to move. Thus, the speed of the sound wave is essentially the
thermal speed of the molecules themselves, which makes for much slower
speed of sound. While we will skip the derivation, one can show that
the speed of sound in an ideal gas is given by
<men>
  v_\text{ sound }  = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma}{3}} v_\text{ therm }  = 
\sqrt{\frac{\gamma RT}{M}}.
</men>
</p>

<p>
We have introduced the parameter <m>\gamma</m>, which is often called
the <q>adiabatic exponent</q> and is defined as
<men>
  \gamma = \frac{f+2}{f},
</men>
where <m>f</m> is again the number of degrees of freedom.
This gives us
<men>
  \gamma = \frac{5}{3} \ \ \text{ (monatomic), \qquad } 
\gamma = \frac{7}{5}=1.4\ \ \text{ (diatomic). }
</men>
</p>

<p>
We will see <m>\gamma</m> again in the next lecture, since it also plays a
role in fundamental gas processes.
</p>

<p>
Notice that the speed of sound in a gas is dependent on the
temperature, since the thermal speed depends on temperature, while for
liquids and solids the speed of sound is essentially independent of
temperature.
</p>

<example>
<statement>
<p>
{The Speed of Sound in Air}
Estimate the speed of sound in air at room temperature of <m>22^\circ\units{C}
 = 295\units{K}</m>. Use the average molar mass based
on an approximate composition of 78<percent /> N<m>_2</m> and 22<percent /> O<m>_2</m>.


<em>Solution: </em>
For the molar mass, we use the molar masses of nitrogen and oxygen
to find
<men>
  M = 0.78 (28\units{g/mol}) + 0.22 (32\units{g/mol}) = 28.9\units{g/mol}.
</men>
</p>

<p>
Both of these gases are diatomic, so we get the sound speed
<md>
  <mrow>  v_\text{ sound }  \amp = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma R T}{M}}  
=\sqrt{\frac{1.4(8.31\units{J/mol$\cdot$K})(295\units{K})}
{0.0289\units{kg/mol}}}\nonumber</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp = 345\units{m/s}.</mrow>
</md>
</p>

<p>
That's a pretty accurate value. To get a more precise value we would need
to know the amount of water vapor in the air and a few other details.

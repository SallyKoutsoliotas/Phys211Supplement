<title>Heat and the First Law of Thermodynamics</title>
<p>
There are many ways to add thermal energy to an object or to remove it
from the object. We have already discussed how friction can increase
the thermal energy of a blow dart as it slides across the floor.
Another way to change the thermal energy is to bring the object into
<em>thermal contact</em> with something hotter or colder. For a pair of
solid objects, thermal contact occurs when they are physically in
contact. Then the molecules at the boundary exert forces on each
other and energy is transferred from the object with the higher
temperature to the object with the lower temperature.
As we have already discussed, temperature directs the flow of
thermal energy, determining which objects will spontaneously give off
energy and which objects will receive it.
</p>

<p>
The energy transferred spontaneously by molecular motion is given the
name <em>heat.</em> Similar to work, heat is an energy transfer and not
an energy. Think of thermal energy as a bank balance and heat and work
as deposits and withdrawals. The distinction between heat and
work is the mechanism for the energy transfer.
</p>

<p>
\boxittext{Heat is the thermal energy transferred spontaneously due
to a temperature difference.}
</p>

<p>
All other forms of energy transfer into a system are lumped
together as thermodynamic <q>work.</q> For example, the term work can refer
to energy transfer due to external forces that act on system (but do not
change the motion of the center of mass of the system)<fn>In Unit 1 
in this course we discussed the work done on a single particle,
and the resulting change in the kinetic energy of the particle.
In thermodynamics we are interested in composite systems, such as gases
liquids, and solids.  In composite systems, work can result in changes in
thermal energy as well as kinetic energy. In the thermodynamic systems
we study, there will be no changes in the bulk kinetic energy 
<m>K_\text{ mech }</m>.</fn>, but it also
encompasses energy transfers due to other things, such as the warming of
a piece of frozen broccoli in a microwave oven. To distinguish the
two forms of energy transfer, it is common to use the symbol <m>Q</m> for heat,
and <m>W</m> for work.
</p>

<p>
Now we can state the first law of thermodynamics, which is simply a
statement of energy conservation: the change in thermal energy is
equal to how much work is done on the system plus how much heat flows
into the system:
<men>
  \Delta E_\text{ therm }  = Q + W \qquad\text{ (1st Law of Thermodynamics) }
</men>
</p>

<p>
Note that <m>Q</m>, like <m>W</m>, can be positive or negative, depending on
whether heat is flowing in or out. The convention used here is to
define the heat <m>Q</m> as being positive if heat is flowing <em>into</em>
the material (and negative if heat is flowing out), and to define
the work <m>W</m> as the work done <em>on</em> the system. Some people find it
convenient to write the first law with these conventions stated
explicitly:
<men xml:id="eq_firstlaw" >
  \Delta E_\text{ therm }  = Q_\text{ in }  + W_\text{ on }  \qquad\text{ (1st Law of Thermodynamics) }
</men>
</p>

<p>
From our perspective today, with energy conservation a fundamental
principle, the 1st law may seem to be pretty obvious. But historically it was a
very significant discovery, showing that indeed heat was just an
energy transfer, rather than some new substance.<fn>Early theories of
thermodynamics proposed <mdash /> incorrectly <mdash /> that heat was some sort of
fluid (called <em>caloric</em>) that flows between hot and cold materials.
We now know, of course, that heat is simply the <q>flow</q> of energy.</fn>
And the
importance of the first law cannot be overstated <mdash /> this seemingly simple
result forms the foundation of much of what we will be doing during
the next couple of weeks.
</p>

<p>
It is worth appreciating what is not heat. Rubbing your hands
together when they are cold certainly does increase their thermal
energy, but not due to heat. There is not a higher temperature object
making energy flow into your hands spontaneously, so there is no heat
flow. Rather, you are doing work with your muscles, and the friction
force between your hands converts the mechanical energy of your moving
hands into thermal energy.
</p>

<example>
<statement>
<p>
{First law}
You hold a <m>35\units{mol}</m> iron anvil in place on a moving conveyor belt
so that the belt slides under the stationary anvil. The belt does
<m>12,000\units{J}</m> of work on the anvil, and and it gets warmer. During
this process, the anvil loses <m>7,000\units{J}</m> to the cooler surrounding air
and to the belt. If the anvil had an initial temperature of
<m>22.0^{\circ}\units{C}</m>, what is its temperature at the end of this
process?
</p>

<p>
<em>Solution: </em>
First, we can use the first law to determine the change in the anvil's
thermal energy. Conceptually, <m>12,000\units{J}</m> is added in the form
of work and <m>7,000\units{J}</m> is removed in the form of a heat flow. In terms
of Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_firstlaw" />, <m>W_\text{ on } =12000\units{J}</m> and
<m>Q_\text{ in } =-7000\units{J}</m> (negative since heat is flowing <em>out</em>
of the anvil). So,
<me>
  \Delta E_\text{ therm }  = Q_\text{ in }  + W_\text{ on }  
     = -7000\units{J} + 12000\units{J}= 5000\units{J}.
</me>
</p>

<p>
We can now use Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_Ethermspecificheat" /> and the molar specific
heat of iron (see <xref ref="table_material_properties">Table</xref> to find the
temperature change of the iron anvil:
<me>
  \Delta E_\text{ therm }  = n C \Delta T.
</me>
</p>

<p>
Solving for the rise in temperature gives
<md>
  <mrow>  \Delta T \amp =\amp  \frac{\Delta E_\text{ therm } }{nC}</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp =\amp  \frac{5000\units{J}}{35\units{mol} \times 25.1\frac{\units{J}}
{\units{mol} \cdot \units{K}}}</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp =\amp  5.7\units{K}</mrow>
</md>
</p>

<p>
The final temperature is therefore <m>22.0^\circ\units{C} + 5.7^\circ\units{C} = 
27.7^\circ\units{C}</m>.
</p>

<p>
Note that we could get a very good approximation of the result here by using
the ideal solid approximation for the molar
specific heat.
</p>
</statement>
</example>

<p>
When a pair of objects is in thermal contact but is otherwise thermally
isolated, we can say that <m>\Delta E_\text{ therm }</m> is equal and opposite
for the two objects, since the thermal energy lost by the hotter object
is gained by the colder object. This brings the objects closer together
in temperature, until finally they have the same temperature and no more
heat flows. This situation is called <em>thermal equilibrium</em>.
</p>

<example>
<statement>
<p>
{Hot Meets Cold}
One mole of an ideal solid at temperature <m>70^\circ\units{C}</m> is
brought into thermal contact with two moles of an ideal solid at
temperature <m>10^\circ\units{C}</m>. How much heat will flow out of the
hotter object before thermal equilibrium is reached?
</p>

<p>
<em>Solution: </em>
We will need to
determine the final equilibrium temperature, <m>T_f</m>.
This is done by balancing the heat flows in and out:
<men xml:id="eq_calorimetry" >
  \Delta
E_\text{ therm,1 }  = -\Delta E_\text{ therm,2 }  
\rangle \Rightarrow\rangle 
n_1 C_1 \underbrace{(T_f - T_{1,i})}_{\Delta T_1} = -n_2 C_2 
\underbrace{(T_f - T_{2,i}) }_{\Delta T_2}
</men>
where <m>T_{1,i}</m> and <m>T_{2,i}</m> are the initial temperatures of objects
1 and 2. Putting in values:
<men>
  (1\units{mol})(3R)(T_f - 70^\circ\units{C})
 = -(2\units{mol})(3R)(T_f - 10^\circ\units{C})
</men>
</p>

<p>
Note that we have used Celsius temperature. This is because <m>\Delta
T</m> is the same whether measured in Kelvin or Celsius (see
Fig. <xref ref="fig_temperature_scales"></xref>). Now we solve:
<men>
  T_f - 70 = -2(T_f-10)\Rightarrow 3T_f = 70+20
</men>
so
<men>
  T_f = \frac{90}{3} = 30^\circ\units{C}.
</men>
</p>

<p>
To complete the calculation, we go back to the change in thermal energy,
Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_calorimetry" />,
<men>
  \Delta E_\text{ therm,1 }  = (1\units{mol})(24.9\units{J/mol$\cdot$K})
(30^\circ\units{C} - 70^\circ\units{C}) = -996\units{J}.
</men>
</p>

<p>
So <m>996\units{J}</m> of heat flowed out of object <m>1</m> and into object <m>2</m>.

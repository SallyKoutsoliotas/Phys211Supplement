<title>Speed of Sound</title>
<p>
How well does this ball-spring picture of a solid work?
One way to test the model is to study the speed of sound in a
solid. Sound is a compression wave, much like a compression pulse
sent down a stretched slinky. If an ideal solid is suddenly
struck at one end, how fast does the compression wave travel toward
the other end? We can almost guess the answer. The wave <q>hops</q>
from one molecule to its neighbor and each hop moves the wave a
distance <m>d</m>. Since the molecules are harmonic oscillators, the time
it takes for a hop must be related to the period of oscillation <m>T</m>,
so we could guess <m>v_\text{ sound }  \approx d/T</m>. It is not difficult
to do the full calculation for the ideal solid<fn>This is
  done in PHYS 221/222.</fn> and find that the answer differs from this
guess by a factor of <m>2\pi</m>:
<men>
  v_\text{ sound }  = \frac{2\pi d}{T} = d\omega  = d\sqrt{\frac{k_\text{ sp } }{m}}
</men>

Thus, the speed of sound in the ideal solid depends on all three
parameters. The values we obtained for copper (be careful to use SI
units here!) give
<men>
  v_\text{ sound }  = 2.28\times
 10^{-10}\units{m}\sqrt{\frac{29.6\units{N/m}}{1.06\times
     10^{-25}\units{kg}}} = 3810\units{m/s}
</men>
which is exactly the measured value for the speed of sound in copper.
Evidently the ideal solid model works quite well. You will make more
comparisons in the homework.

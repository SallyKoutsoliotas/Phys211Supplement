<title>The Solid State</title>
<p>
Molecules interacting via the pair potential can be solids, liquids,
or gases. The remainder of this chapter is concerned with the thermal
energy of the solid state, while liquid and gas states will be
presented in <xref ref="chapter_liquids_and_gases">Chapter</xref>.
</p>

<p>
Most inorganic solids are crystalline, which means the molecules are
arranged in a symmetric way, such as a cubic lattice. (Organic
solids instead are constructed from long carbon chains.) In this
lattice, each pair of neighboring molecules is separated by roughly
the equilibrium distance, that is, the minimum of the pair potential
well, and only makes small excursions from this location. As
illustrated in Fig. <xref ref="fig_pair_potential_spring"></xref>, the pair
potential in this region is identical to a parabolic potential. We
have previously encountered a parabolic potential energy curve as the
potential energy for a mass on a spring. Evidently, as long as the
molecules in a solid are not deviating significantly from their
equilibrium position, we may regard their interactions with their
nearest neighbors as equivalent to being attached by a spring.
</p>

<p>
\boxittext{<sc>Checkpoint:</sc> What is the main difference between the pair
potential and the spring potential? What would I need to do to a
pair of molecules to see this difference? (Push together? Pull
apart? How far?) }
</p>
<figure xml:id="fig_pair_potential_spring" >

  function of separation <m>r</m>.  The dashed line is the spring potential
  <m>U_ spring</m> with the spring constant <m>k_{\text sp}</m> chosen to match
  <m>U_\text{ pair }</m> near the minimum.  The inset shows the match.</caption>

<p>
This leads to what we call the <em>ideal solid</em>:
the molecules are balls of mass <m>m</m>, they are connected by springs of
spring constant <m>k_\text{ sp }</m>, and the springs have an equilibrium length
of <m>d</m>. This model is illustrated in Fig. <xref ref="fig_ball-spring"></xref>. We
may think of the spring constant as determining the bond strength and
the equilibrium length <m>d</m> as the bond length. These three parameters
(<m>m</m>, <m>d</m>, and <m>k_\text{ sp }</m>) define the model, and we shall see that for
many solids determining these parameters describes much of the
behavior of the solid.
</p>

<p>
One may imagine packing the molecules together in different ways. The
arrangement illustrated in Fig. <xref ref="fig_ball-spring"></xref>, is called a
<em>simple cubic</em> lattice. In fact, most solids are packed
differently, for example, in the way a grocer would stack oranges
(which is called a <em>face-centered cubic</em> lattice). Fortunately,
this distinction has little impact on the quantities we will study, so
we will stick with the simple cubic lattice.

<p>
Given the properties of some solid, how are the ideal solid
parameters determined? Let's derive these for a specific case, namely
copper. Molecular properties, such as mass, are usually not specified
for a single molecule, but rather for a <em>mole</em>. One mole equals
Avogadro's number
<men>
  N_A=6.02\times 10^{23}
</men>
of molecules. Avogadro's number is chosen so that roughly one mole of
protons has a mass of one gram. The precise definition is that one
mole of carbon atoms has a mass of <m>12\units{g}</m>. The mass of one mole
of a material would logically be called the molar mass, but instead it
is usually called the <em>molecular weight</em>.<fn>It's not our fault.</fn>
</p>

<p>
One mole of copper has mass <m>64\units{g}</m>, so we may conclude that a
single molecule of copper (the ball in our model) has mass
<men>
  m_\text{ Cu }  = \frac{64\units{g}}{6.02\times 10^{23}} = 1.06\times
10^{-22}\units{g}.
</men>
</p>

<p>
This is the first of our three parameters.
</p>

<p>
Next, we can get the equilibrium spacing <m>d</m> between the molecules by
knowing the density of copper, which is <m>8.94\units{g/cm</m>^3<m>}</m>.
In Fig. <xref ref="fig_ball-spring-volume"></xref> shows that each molecule of copper
occupies its own cubical region with volume <m>d^3</m>.
We can relate the density <m>\rho</m> of the solid to the mass per volume
of a unit cell. That is,
<men>
  \rho = \frac{\text{ mass } }{\text{ volume } } = \frac{m}{d^3} 
  \qquad \Rightarrow\qquad d =
\left(\frac{m}{\rho}\right)^{1/3}.
</men>
</p>

<p>
For copper this gives
<men>
  d_\text{ Cu }  = \left(\frac{m_\text{ Cu } }{\rho_\text{ Cu } }\right)^{1/3}
 =  \left(\frac{1.06\times
     10^{-22}\units{g}}{8.94\units{g/cm$^3$}}\right)^{1/3}
 = 2.28\times 10^{-8}\units{cm},
</men>
or equivalently, <m>2.28\times 10^{-10}\units{m}</m>.
And so we have the second parameter.
</p>
<figure xml:id="fig_ball-spring-volume" >

balls, the volume per ball is given by a cube of side <m>d</m> (shown here
in two-dimensions).</caption>

The final step is to determine the spring constant. Fortunately, it
is not necessary to try pulling on a single molecule and measuring the
force that it pulls back with. Rather, a macroscopic chunk of
material can be fixed at one end and pulled on the other, and by
measuring how much the object stretches, the bond spring constant can
be measured.
</p>

<p>
Imagine a piece of copper wire with cross-sectional area <m>A</m> and
length <m>L</m>. The applied force required to stretch the wire by an amount
<m>\Delta L</m> is given by the following relation:
<men xml:id="eq_force_extension" >
  F_\text{ app }  = \frac{Y A}{L}\Delta L.
</men>
</p>

<p>
This relation indicates that the amount of stretch <m>\Delta L</m> is
proportional to the amount of force applied; doubling the force will
double the amount of stretch from the equilibrium length. A larger
cross-sectional area <m>A</m> makes the wire harder to stretch, which
accounts for the factor of <m>A</m> in the numerator. The longer the wire,
the easier it is to stretch, accounting for the factor of <m>L</m> in the
denominator. The final parameter <m>Y</m> is called Young's modulus,
and is a property of the material but not dependent on the geometry
of the wire. For example, Young's modulus for copper is
<m>Y_\text{ Cu }  \approx 130\times 10^9 \units{N/m</m>^2<m>}</m>.
</p>

<example>
<statement>
<p>
{Stretching an Extension Cord}
Consider 16 gauge copper wire, commonly used in power cables, which
has a
cross-sectional area of <m>1.3\times 10^{-6}\units{m</m>^2<m>}</m>. How much
force is required to stretch a 2-meter length of wire a distance of
1 centimeter?


<em>Solution: </em>
According to Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_force_extension" />, the force is given by
<md>
  <mrow>  F_\text{ app }  = \frac{Y_\text{ Cu } A}{L}\Delta L \amp =
 \displaystyle\frac{(130\times 10^9\units{N/m$^2$})(1.3\times
  10^{-6}\units{m$^2$})} {2\units{m}} (0.01\units{m}) \nonumber</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp = 845\units{N}.</mrow>
</md>
</p>
</statement>
</example>

<p>
Now we need to calculate Young's modulus for the ideal solid.
Consider a rectangular solid of <m>N_x \times N_y \times N_z</m> molecules.
The object is stretched in the <m>z</m>-direction by an applied force <m>F</m>,
with a resulting stretch <m>\Delta L</m>. The stretch is shared equally
among each of the <m>N_z</m> springs aligned in the <m>z</m>-direction, so each
spring is stretched an amount <m>\Delta L/N_z</m>. The plane of molecules
where the force is applied consists of <m>N_xN_y</m> molecules, each
connected to a spring pulling with force <m>k_\text{ sp } \Delta L/N_z</m>. This
spring force is balancing the applied force, so we can conclude that
<men>
  F_\text{ app } = N_xN_y \left(\frac{k_\text{ sp }  \Delta L}{N_z}\right).
</men>
</p>

<p>
If we multiply top and bottom by <m>d^2</m> we can identify the
cross-sectional area <m>A=(N_x d)(N_y d)</m>, and the length <m>L=N_z d</m>:
<men>
  F_\text{ app } =\frac{d^2N_xN_y k_\text{ sp } }{d^2 N_z} \Delta L 
                = \frac{k_\text{ sp } }{d}
\frac{A}{L}\Delta L
</men>
from which we conclude that Young's modulus for the ideal solid
is
<men>
  Y=\frac{k_\text{ sp } }{d}.
</men>
</p>

<p>
This can be used to find the spring constant, <m>k_\text{ sp }  = Yd</m>. For
example, for copper
<men>
  k_\text{ sp }  = (130\times 10^9\units{N/m$^2$})(2.28\times 10^{-10}\units{m})
 = 29.6\units{N/m}.
</men>
</p>

<p>
In this way, we can find all three ideal solid parameters from
knowing the molecular weight, the density, and Young's modulus.

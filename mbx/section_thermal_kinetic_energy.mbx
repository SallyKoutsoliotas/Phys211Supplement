<title>Thermal Kinetic Energy</title>
<p>
First, let's consider molecular kinetic energy. Consider a set of <m>N</m>
molecules, each with the same mass <m>m</m>, with velocities <m>\vec v_1</m>,
<m>\vec v_2</m>, <ellipsis />, <m>\vec v_N</m>. We will show that the kinetic energy
associated with these moving molecules can be separated into
mechanical kinetic energy and thermal kinetic energy. The first step
is to calculate the motion of what is called the <em>center of mass.</em>
At some particular instant in time, the positions of each particle are
given by the vectors <m>\vec r_1</m>, <m>\vec r_2</m>, <ellipsis />, <m>\vec r_N</m>. The
location of the center of mass, denoted by the vector <m>\vec r_{cm}</m>,
is the average of these positions
<men>
  \vec r_{cm} = \frac{1}{N}(\vec r_1 + \vec r_2 + \dots + \vec r_N).
</men>
</p>

<p>
Taking a time derivative of this equation gives
<men>
  \vec v_{cm} = \frac{d\vec r_{cm}}{dt} =
\frac{1}{N}(\vec v_1 + \vec v_2 + \dots + \vec v_N),
</men>
so the center of mass velocity is simply the average velocity (in this
simplified case of equal masses).
</p>

<p>
For a rigid object, like a solid, the velocity of the center of mass
is simply the velocity of the object. If the center of mass velocity
of some object is zero, then that object, viewed macroscopically, is at
rest. A ball sitting on a table has a stationary center of mass, and
therefore no mechanical kinetic energy. However, the individual
molecules of the ball are certainly not at rest and do have kinetic
energy. The motion appears random, with molecules moving in every
direction; some molecules moving faster and some slower. It is this
molecular kinetic energy which we identify as thermal
energy.<fn>For simplicity, we are excluding the possibility of
  rotations.</fn>
</p>

<p>
\boxittext{The thermal kinetic energy of an object is simply the
molecular kinetic energy when the center of mass is at
rest.}
</p>

<p>
What about the case where the center of mass is moving? For example,
if the ball is not sitting on the table but rather flying through the
air. It is still possible to identify the thermal kinetic energy,
because there is always some co-moving reference frame in which the
ball is at rest. The molecular motion as viewed in that
frame will again be the thermal kinetic energy.
</p>

<p>
But nevertheless we may ask if
it is possible to identify the thermal kinetic energy in a frame where
the ball is moving. And indeed, it is possible. The velocity <m>\vec
v_i</m> of the <m>i</m>th molecule can be written as a sum of the center of
mass velocity <m>\vec v_{cm}</m> and the velocity of the particle relative
to the center of mass <m>\vec v_{i,rel}</m>. That is, <m>\vec v_i = \vec
v_{cm} + \vec v_{i,rel}</m>. Then the total kinetic energy is the sum
over all particles:
<md>
  <mrow>  K_\text{ total }  \amp =
{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}\sum_i m (\vec v_{cm}+\vec v_{i,rel})\cdot  
(\vec v_{cm}+\vec v_{i,rel}) \nonumber</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp = {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}\sum_i m\, v_{cm}^2 
+\sum_i m\,\vec v_{cm}\cdot \vec v_{i,rel}
+ {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}\sum_i m\, v_{i,rel}^2.</mrow>
</md>
</p>

<p>
Note that <m>\vec v_{cm}</m> is the same for all particles, so it can be
brought outside the sum over particles. Then the first term becomes
<men>
  {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}\sum_i m\, v_{cm}^2  = {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}v_{cm}^2
\sum_i m = {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}Mv_{cm}^2,
</men>
where <m>M</m> is the total mass of all the particles. This is exactly the
mechanical kinetic energy we have already encountered. The second
term can be written as
<men>
  m\vec v_{cm} \cdot \left( \sum \vec v_{i,rel}\right).
</men>
</p>

<p>
Since <m>\vec v_{i,rel}</m> is the particle velocity relative to the center
of mass frame, the sum <m>\sum \vec v_{i,rel}=0</m>, and this term
vanishes. The last term in Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_kinetic_energy" /> is just the
total kinetic energy measured in a frame moving with the center of
mass, which is the thermal kinetic energy. Putting this all together,
<men>
  K = K_\text{ mech }  + K_\text{ therm } ,
</men>
thus the kinetic energy divides cleanly into mechanical and thermal
kinetic energy.

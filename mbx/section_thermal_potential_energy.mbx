<title>Thermal Potential Energy</title>
<p>
Thermal energy is not just kinetic, but also involves potential
energy. Molecules exert forces on each other, pushing and
pulling.<fn>The origin of these forces is the electric force
  interactions between the charges of the atoms combined with quantum
  mechanics, which governs the location of the charges.  Both of these
  topics will be covered in PHYS 212.</fn> These forces are conservative,
so there is a potential energy associated with each pair of molecules.
To understand this potential energy, we must first consider the force
between an isolated pair of molecules. There are three distinct
regimes, depending on how far apart the two molecules are.
<ul>
<li><p>When the molecules are closer than a molecular diameter, they
exert a strong repulsive force on each other.</p></li>
<li><p>When the molecules are within a few molecular diameters, they
exert attractive forces on each other.</p></li>
<li><p>When the molecules are more than a few molecular diameters away
from each other, the force becomes negligibly small.</p></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
This behavior is captured by what is called the <em>pair
potential</em>, shown in Fig. <xref ref="fig_pair_potential"></xref>, which is the
potential energy <m>U_\text{ pair } (r)</m> due to a pair of molecules
separated by a distance <m>r</m>. The diagram illustrates the three
regions. Notice that at a separation <m>r=d</m>, where <m>d</m> is the
molecular diameter, there is an equilibrium point dividing the regions
of attractive and repulsive forces.
</p>

<p>
As we shall see in the next two chapters, this pair potential explains
the existence of solid, liquid, and gas phases, and many details of
the phases and of the transitions between the phases. It is one of
the remarkable triumphs of the atomic theory of matter that so much
behavior can be explained by such a simple model of the forces between
atoms!
</p>

<p>
In principle, the <em>system</em> potential energy for a system of <m>N</m>
molecules contains the pair potential energy for every single pairing
of the molecules. This is a very large number of pairs! Fortunately,
only those molecules which are immediate neighbors are close enough to
have an appreciable force and potential energy, so we only need to
consider the potential energy due to neighboring molecules.

  <m>r</m>, the separation between the pair of molecules.  The dashed lines
  separate the regions of repulsive force, attractive force, and
  negligible force.  At separation <m>r=d</m> the pair is in equilibrium,
  which defines the molecular diameter.</caption>

What about other sources of potential energy besides the
intermolecular forces? For example, gravitational potential energy.
When a ball is thrown upwards, the gravitational potential energy of
each molecule increases. But the height of each molecule is increased
by the same amount that the height of the center of mass is increased.
Therefore this change in potential energy has the form
<men>
  \Delta U_\text{ grav }  = M_\text{ object }  g\Delta y_{cm},
</men>
where <m>M_\text{ object }</m> is again the total mass of the object. This
is the familiar mechanical potential energy. Therefore, gravitational
potential energy is always part of the mechanical energy, whereas the
molecular interaction energy makes up the thermal potential energy.
</p>

<p>
In summary, here is the big picture for thermal energy:
<ul>
<li><p>For both potential energy and kinetic energy, it is the
  `organized' motion that makes up the <em>mechanical energy</em>, such as
  all molecules increasing their height together or all molecules
  having a net alignment of their velocities.</p></li>
<li><p>The remaining disorganized motion, such as the wiggling of the
  molecules and their individual pushes and pulls on each other,
  corresponds to the <em>thermal energy</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Friction is an agent that takes organized motion and
  disorganizes it, taking away mechanical energy and increasing thermal
  energy.</p></li>
<li><p>Going the other way <mdash /> taking away thermal energy and
  increasing mechanical energy <mdash /> is more difficult, since molecules
  are not likely to spontaneously start moving together.
  Nevertheless, we can capture some amount of thermal energy and
  convert it to mechanical energy with a device called a heat engine,
  which is the topic of Supplementary Reading <xref ref="chapter_heat_engines">Chapter</xref>.</p></li>
</ul>

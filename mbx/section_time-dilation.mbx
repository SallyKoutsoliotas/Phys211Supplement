<title>Time dilation</title>
<p>
The most startling consequence of the invariance of the speed of light
is that it forces us to abandon the notion of absolute time. This
means the time interval between two events depends on the velocity of
the clocks used to measure the interval. The following <em>thought
experiment</em> should help you understand this concept of the
relativity of time intervals.
</p>

<p>
Imagine three identical clocks constructed as follows. Each clock
contains a light source that emits a pulse of light toward a mirror
some fixed distance away (see <xref ref="fig_light-clocks">Figure</xref>a). The
mirror reflects the pulse back toward the source. When the reflected
pulse returns to the source and hits a triggering device, the source
immediately fires a second pulse, which reflects from the mirror and
triggers a third pulse, and so on. A count registers in a counter for
each return pulse so the number of counts becomes a measure of elapsed
time.
</p>

<p>
We place two of these light clocks, A and B, a fixed distance apart
and at rest in a reference frame attached to the constant velocity
Earth. We put the third clock, C, on a spaceship traveling at a
constant velocity <m>\vec{v}</m> relative to the Earth (see
Fig. <xref ref="fig_light-clocks"></xref>b), and perpendicular to the direction of
travel of the light pulse in the clocks.
</p>

  dotted line shows the path of C's light pulse as observed in the
  rest frame of A and B.</caption>

</figure>
<p>
Suppose clock C emits a light pulse at the exact instant it passes
clock A. Also suppose that the distance between A and B is such that
clock C passes clock B at the precise instant clock C's reflected
pulse returns to the source. We therefore have two events: Event <hash />1
= <q>C passes A</q> and Event <hash />2 = <q>C passes B.</q> We label the time
interval between these two events <mdash /> measured by clock C <mdash /> as
<m>\Delta t_C</m>. The quantity <m>\Delta t_C</m> is called the <em>proper
time</em> interval between the two events; <em><em>proper time is
defined as the time measured on a single clock that is present at
both events</em></em>. In the case discussed above, clock C measures the
proper time. In our particular arrangement, the proper time is
exactly one tick.
</p>

<p>
We now pose the crucial question, the answer to which is the key to
understanding all of special relativity.
</p>
<blockquote>
<em>What is the elapsed time</em> <m>\Delta t_{AB}</m> <em>as measured by
clocks A and B for clock C to travel from A to B?</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
<q>Simple,</q> you might think. <q>The answer is obviously exactly one
tick, the same as that measured by clock C, right?</q> Wrong. As we
will see, the concepts of absolute time (i.e., everyone and everything
measures the passage of time the say way) is a casualty of the
invariance of the speed of light.
</p>

<p>
For the question posed above to have any meaning, clocks A and B must
be synchronized; i.e., observers in the Earth's reference frame would
say that the two clocks are reading the same time. (Note: this is not
a trivial matter <mdash /> we will discuss synchronization more fully in
<xref ref="chapter_relativistic_spacetime">Chapter</xref>.) The two-clock time
<m>\Delta t_{AB}</m> is then the difference between the time reading on
clock A at Event <hash />1 (clock C at clock A) and the time reading on
clock B at Event <hash />2 (clock C at clock B).
</p>

<p>
In clock C's reference frame, clock A passes C first, and then clock B
passes C. The time interval between these events is <m>\Delta t_C</m> on
clock C and therefore the light pulse in clock C travels a round-trip
distance equal to <m>c\Delta t_C</m>. But from Fig. <xref ref="fig_light-clocks"></xref>
this same pulse (the one inside clock C) travels a longer, zig-zag
path when viewed from the frame in which clocks A and B are at rest.
Because of the invariance of the speed of light, <em>this longer
distance must translate into a longer time interval.</em> This means
the round trip time for clock C's pulse is one tick as measured on
clock C, but it is more than one tick when measured on clocks A and B.
In other words, the elapsed time between the event <q>C passes A</q> and
the event <q>C passes B</q> is <em>longer</em> when measured with the two
clocks A and B than when measured with the single clock C.
</p>
<figure xml:id="fig_rel_triangle" >
<caption>Diagram for derivation of the proper time relation.  In 
    this figure <m>\Delta t_{AB}</m> is the elapsed time determined from 
    the clocks A and B, and <m>\Delta t_C</m> is the elapsed time on clock C.</caption>
<image width="73%" source="images/rel1_triangle.png" />
</figure>
<p>
How much longer is the time interval <m>\Delta t_{AB}</m> measured on the A
and B clocks than the proper time interval <m>\Delta t_C</m> measured on
clock C? We can find out by looking at the path taken by the pulse of
light in clock C viewed from C's reference frame and from A and B's
reference frame (see Fig. <xref ref="fig_rel_triangle"></xref>). As we've already
seen, in clock C's frame the pulse travels straight up and down along
the vertical line in the figure and the total round-trip distance is
<m>c\Delta t_C</m>. The same pulse, traveling for time <m>\Delta t_{AB}</m>
relative to A and B travels the total zigzag distance <m>c\Delta
t_{AB}</m>. Clock C itself travels a distance <m>v\Delta t_{AB}</m> relative
to clocks A and B while the pulse makes one round-trip in C.
Therefore, using the Pythagorean theorem on either small triangle in
Fig. <xref ref="fig_rel_triangle"></xref>, we find
<men>
  \left(\frac{c\Delta t_{AB}}{2}\right)^2 = 
\left(\frac{c\Delta t_{C}}{2}\right)^2 + 
\left(\frac{v\Delta t_{AB}}{2}\right)^2,
</men>
from which we solve for the proper time <m>\Delta t_C</m> to obtain
<men>
  \Delta t_C = \Delta t_{AB}\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}.
</men>
</p>

<p>
This relation can be written in the general form:
</p>

<p>
\begin{boxiteq}
{
<men xml:id="eq_ptr" >
  \Delta t_{ proper} = \Delta t_{ two-clock}\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}.
</men>
</p>

<p>
}
\end{boxiteq}
</p>

<p>
This very important relation is sometimes called the
<q>proper time relation</q> or the principle of <q>time dilation.</q>
Qualitatively, it expresses the fact that <em><em>different
observers measure the passage of time differently depending on their
relative motion.</em></em>
</p>

<p>
Hidden inside Eq.<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_ptr" /> is another result from special
relativity; namely, no object can travel at a speed greater than <m>c</m>
relative to any other object or reference frame. A superluminal speed
(<m>|v| > c</m>) would result in an imaginary proper time, something that
has no physical meaning. You will learn later that this speed limit
is imposed by energy considerations as well (it would take an infinite
amount of energy to accelerate an object with mass<fn>Of course,
a photon of light can be considered an <q>object</q> that travels at 
a speed <m>c</m>, but this is a massless object.  We'll say more about this 
in <xref ref="chapter_relativity_pande">Chapter</xref>.</fn> to a speed <m>v = c</m>
relative to an observer, and <em>more</em> than an infinite amount of
energy to achieve a speed <m>v > c</m>). Therefore, because <m>|v| \leq c</m>,
the proper time interval <m>\Delta t_{ proper}</m> between two events
is always <em>smaller</em> than the time <m>\Delta t_{ two-clock}</m>
measured in a frame that requires two synchronized clocks for
measurement.
</p>

<example>
<statement>
<p>
{Time dilation.}
A father and his daughter are traveling on a train that moves with a
constant speed of <m>1.8\times 10^8\units{m/s}</m> (<m>= 0.6c</m>)
relative to the ground. They pass a parked VW Beetle at which point
the two of them simultaneously yell, <q>Red Punch Buggy!</q> and punch each
other on the shoulder. Three seconds later, the daughter yells,
<q>Jinx!</q> What is the time between these two events according to a
person inside the VW who is waiting for the train to pass?


<em>Solution: </em>
The key question <mdash /> who measures the proper time (i.e., the
smaller time interval)? To answer this, write this down in terms of
events. Event A <m>=</m> father/daughter punch each other; Event B <m>=</m>
daughter jinxes her dad. In this example, the father/daughter are at
both events (not the person in the car), so they measure the smaller
(proper) time interval, which has already been stated to be <m>3\units{s}</m>.
So, we are given <m>\Delta t_{ proper}</m> and we are solving for
<m>\Delta t_{ two-clock}</m>,
which is the time interval measured by the person in the car.
<md>
  <mrow>  \Delta t_{ proper} \amp = \Delta t_{ two-clock}\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2} \nonumber</mrow>
  <mrow>  \Rightarrow \Delta t_{ train} \amp = 
                \Delta t_{ VW}\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}\nonumber</mrow>
  <mrow>  \Rightarrow \Delta t_{ VW} \amp = 
                \frac{\Delta t_{ train}}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}\nonumber</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp = \frac{3\units{s}}{\sqrt{1-(0.6c/c)^2}}\nonumber</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp = \frac{3\units{s}}{\sqrt{1-0.6^2}}\nonumber</mrow>
  <mrow>  \amp = 3.75\units{s}.</mrow>
</md>
</p>
</statement>
</example>

<p>
In this example, the father and daughter on the train measured the
proper time because they were at both events, so the time interval is
smaller from their reference frame. Be careful, though: sometimes the
observer standing on the Earth measures the smaller time interval <mdash /> it
all depends on what the events are and who happens to be present at
both of them.
</p>

<p>
Note also that we expressed <m>v</m> as a fraction of the speed of light <mdash /> it
makes things a lot simpler to write <m>v</m> in this manner. We'll say more
about this later

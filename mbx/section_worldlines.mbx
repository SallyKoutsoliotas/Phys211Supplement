<title>World Lines and Spacetime Diagrams</title>
<p>
The motions of particles, clocks, or whatever can be represented on a
spacetime diagram. A spacetime diagram consists of a pair of
perpendicular axes, with the vertical axis representing time and the
horizontal axis representing <m>x</m> position in a particular inertial
reference frame. The <m>x</m>-axis is the direction of relative motion
between this unprimed frame and another inertial frame called the
primed frame.
</p>

<p>
A plot of an object's position vs.<nbsp />time on a spacetime diagram is
called the <em>world line</em> of the object. Three world lines are
shown in Fig. <xref ref="fig_spacetime-example"></xref>; a straight world line
represents motion with constant velocity while a curved world line
represents accelerated motion. An <em>event</em> is represented by a dot
on the spacetime diagram.
</p>

<p>
When drawing a spacetime diagram, make sure you use appropriate units.
(Do <em>not</em> use meters for length!) For time (which we use as the
vertical axis on a spacetime diagram), we choose something appropriate
to the time scale of the problem, like years, seconds, nanoseconds,
etc. Then we must choose an appropriate unit of distance equal to
that traveled by light in the chosen unit of time. For example,
suppose we choose one second as the unit of time, then we would used
one lt-s (the distance traveled by light in one second) as the unit of
distance. In these units the speed of light is <m>c = 
(1\units{lt-s})/(1\units{s}) = 1\units{lt-s/s}</m>. In this method of
handling the units, the world line for a pulse of light must have a
slope that is numerically equal to <m>+1</m> or <m>-1</m>. <em>And no world line
can ever have a slope with magnitude less than 1; that would
correspond to an object traveling faster than light.</em> Slopes can also
be used to determine if the interval between two events is time-like,
light-like or space-like. If a line were to be drawn connecting the
two events, a time-like interval would correspond to a slope with
magnitude greater than 1, a light-like interval would correspond to a
slope with magnitude 1, and space-like interval would correspond to a
slope with magnitude less than 1 (note that in this last case, that
the <q>line</q> drawn between the two events can't be the world line
of any real object, since nothing can travel faster than <m>c</m>).

Let's use a spacetime diagram to display the world lines of the
three-clock thought experiment of Ch. <xref ref="chapter_relativityI"></xref>,
<xref ref="section_time-dilation">Section</xref> (see Fig. <xref ref="fig_light-clocks"></xref>
from that section and Fig. <xref ref="fig_worldlines1"></xref> in this section).
For example, put clock A at rest at <m>x = 0</m> and clock B at rest at <m>x
= 0.60\units{lt-s}</m>. The world lines for the stationary clocks A
and B are then vertical lines at <m>x = 0\units{lt-s}</m> and <m>x =
0.60\units{lt-s}</m>. Let clock C travel with speed <m>0.60c</m> in the
positive <m>x</m>-direction. Because <m>c = 1\units{lt-s/s}</m>, clock C
passes through <m>x = 0</m> at time <m>t = 0\units{s}</m>, and it passes
through <m>x = 0.60\units{lt-s}</m> at time <m>t = 1.0\units{s}</m>. It has
traveled a distance of <m>0.60\units{lt-s}</m> in a time <m>1.0\units{s}</m>.
</p>

<p>
Notice in Fig. <xref ref="fig_worldlines1"></xref> that we have labeled the world
line of clock C as the <m>t^\prime</m> axis. This is a general result: the
world line of a particular observer (say, someone traveling in a space
ship) is the <m>t^\prime</m> axis for that observer. This can be
understood by considering a person on a spaceship holding a ball. The
world line for the ball is the same as the world line of the ship and
person since they are all moving together. From the perspective of
the astronaut, the ball remains right in front of him and isn't moving
anywhere, so it makes sense that that astronaut will say that the
location of the ball remains at <m>x^\prime = 0</m>. And just as it is
true that the points where <m>x = 0</m> in the unprimed frame define the
<m>t</m>-axis, so it is that the points where <m>x^\prime = 0</m> in the primed
frame define the <m>t^\prime</m>-axis.

Some comments are in order:
<ol>
<li><p>A world line is nothing more than a plot of time versus
position.  If you ever find yourself stumped about how to plot a
world-line, ask yourself: <q>Where is the (whatever) at time <m>t=0</m>
(i.e., what is its initial <m>x</m>-coordinate)?  Where is it at time 
<m>t=1</m>?  At time <m>t=2</m>?  <ellipsis /></q>  Then simply plot those points 
and connect them.</p></li>
<li><p>The slope of a world line is simply <m>1/v</m>.  This comes from the
  standard relation: distance = speed <times /> time, or equivalently, 
  <m>\Delta x= v \Delta t</m>.   So <m>\Delta t =
  \frac{1}{v}\Delta x</m>.  Practically, this means that if you have a ship
  moving at a speed of, say, <m>0.5c</m>, then the slope will be <m>1/ v</m> or
  <m>2.0\units{s/lt-s}</m>.  When plotting a world line, this means that
  you go up 2 and over 1 (or over 0.5 and up 1).</p></li>
<li><p>Don't <em>ever</em> forget <mdash /> nothing can travel faster than
light, so there should <em>never</em> be a world line on a spacetime diagram
 with a
slope whose magnitude is less than 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember: events are plotted as dots.</p></li>
<li><p>Label everything clearly.</p></li>

<example xml:id="example_causality-intervals-diagram">
<statement>
<p>
{Spacetime diagram corresponding to
<xref ref="example_causality-intervals">Example</xref>} Draw the spacetime diagram
for the baseball scenario (Cubs losing the World Series) discussed
in <xref ref="example_causality-intervals">Example</xref>, using the reference
frame of the Earth/Moon. Show the world lines for Anthony Rizzo, Jr.,
the girl and her father, and the TV signal. Also, show and label
the following events: A <mdash /> girl sneezes, B <mdash /> Rizzo strikes out, and
C <mdash /> girl and father see Rizzo striking out. 

<em>Solution: </em> The world
lines for Rizzo and the girl/father are simply straight vertical lines
since they aren't moving in the Earth-Moon reference frame. If this
isn't clear, then answer these questions: If we put the Earth at <m>x
  = 0</m> at time <m>t = 0</m>, where is the Earth at time <m>t=1\units{s}</m>?
Answer: still at <m>x = 0</m>. At <m>t=2\units{s}</m>? Answer: still at <m>x =
  0</m>. The Earth's world line is nothing more that a set of points
where <m>x</m> is always zero. As for the girl/father on the Moon, we
already said in <xref ref="example_causality-intervals">Example</xref> that they
are about <m>1.3\units{lt-s}</m> away from the Earth.
</p>

<p>
We know from the problem that the girl/father see the strikeout
<m>2\units{s}</m> after she sneezes. So, if she sneezes at <m>t = 0</m> (it is
arbitrary as to what we choose as the <m>t = 0</m> time), then the TV
signal arrives at <m>t = 2\units{s}</m>. It must have been sent from the
Earth at an earlier time, and since it travels at the speed of light,
then the world line for the TV signal is a <m>45^\circ</m> line. The only
thing left is to plot the three dots for the events.
</p>

<p>
Note that if you imagine a line between A and B, that line would
have a slope with magnitude less than 1 (i.e., too shallow),
indicating that nothing can travel between these two events,
consistent with the result in Example 1 that the interval is space-like
and the corresponding events can't be causally linked.
